          <p style="width: 746px;">Over the past week or so, I've been ordering
            and collecting parts for two projects I've been itching to build
            since I went to my local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">barcamp</a>.
            And now that I've learned to solder, I can dive in head first.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">The first project I'm going to complete is a
            <a href="https://makezine.com/projects/build-raspberry-pi-powered-linux-laptop-that-fits-your-pocket/?"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi powered Linux laptop</a>.
            This is a tiny, nintendo DS sized laptop that mainly runs terminal
            commands and code, but you can run video and audio on it and it'll
            work just as well!</p>
          <p>Here are the supplies, and the supply list:<span id="selectionBoundary_1508202225322_20702988613140594"

            <li>Case</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="width: 746px;">All of these came out to approximately ~$140,
            which my grandma generously helped me pay for. We bought from ebay,
            Amazon, Sparkfun, and Arrow. I had little to no knowledge about many
            of the things used in this project, so I'll go over each item before
            writing out my to-do list.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">The Raspberry Pi and I have had plenty of
            previous experience with each other, it's the little computer
            powering the whole thing.<br>
            The Adafruit PiTFT is a little touchscreen perfect for the size of
            computer I'm building.<br>
            The Lithium Ion Polymer battery was a confusing buy, since I'd never
            heard of the term mAh before. mAh stands for milliamp hours, which
            measures the amount of coloumbs (electrical charge) stored inside of
            it. (if you do the math like I had to, it helps make sense.)<br>
            The wireless keyboard I got off of Amazon for about $10, it has
            bluetooth capability, but says it only works with certain operating
            systems. We'll see about that.<br>
            The 5.5V to 3.3V step down converter was probably the hardest thing
            I had to find, but I got a good deal on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/3V-Out-5V-to-12V-In-AMS1117-3-0-Step-Down-Linear-Voltage-Regulator-Module-/391834247531?"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">eBay</a> for one thanks to my
            friend Gector.<br>
            The Adafruit Powerboost 1000c is I think what helps recharge the
            battery that powers the RPi and the keyboard.It's super tiny, and
            actually really cute.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">I got most of the other stuff off of
            Sparkfun, two little 3-pin switches, the female USB connectors, the
            audio/video jack, and the wifi dongle.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">As for the case, in the tutorial this guy
            uses cheap HDD cases. I could not find any that fit to my liking,
            they were all either the wrong size or shape, or they came from
            China and I was too impatient to purchase one from there. That's
            when I was struck by a brilliant idea. Why not 3D print the case? (I
            know, great idea.)</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">I attempted to teach myself Sketchup, but
            quickly realized that I was too inexperienced to try and model
            something myself. Gector offered to help, and he made an <em>awesome</em>
            case for me that I'm getting 3D printed by one of my other friends.</p>
          <p>Here's a preview of the case before I print it!</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;"><br>
            <img src="../images/arkenpi2.png" title="arkenpi case"></p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">Once I get it all 3D printed I'll post more
            pictures with the dimensions.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">According to the tutorial, my next steps are
            to desolder all the components off of the RPi, Adafruit PiTFT, and
            wire everything up to the keyboard and battery. I gotta solder new
            wires onto the USB, Audio/Video, and HDMI ports, and get the MicroSD
            of the RPi set up.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">I definitely have my work cut out for me, but
            once this project is physically done, I want to write an OS
            (operating system) for the Raspberry Pi specifically to accompany
            this project.</p>
          <p>I'll update soon as I start working on this!</p>
