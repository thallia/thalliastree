          <p>For an assignment in my class we were to research and analyze a
            current world problem. I chose GMOs, a controversial topic of today.</p>
          <p>The goal I intended with this paper is to educate. I wanted every
            claim and statement I made to have a legitimate source or study so I
            could specifically state the facts, and to accurately portray what
            is actually going on behind the scenes in the companies that produce
            GMOs and what they are doing in our bodies.</p>

          <p>The topic of genetically modified foods has drifted around the
            media more than once, concerning the health effects and worries of
            farmers and activists around the world. It is a controversial topic
            in many aspects, but it is a topic that should be discussed
            nonetheless. GMOs should not be so quickly accepted as a safe and
            healthy food source in the United States. I came to this conclusion
            by researching extensively through the history of genetically
            modified organisms, the companies that produce them, how GMOs are
            used around the world, the studies completed, the cost-benefit
            economic analyses of GMOs, and how the government regulates them.</p>
          <p>The first ideas of genetically modified DNA came from a Stanford
            University graduate in 1973, whose idea proliferated amongst the
            minds of scientists for years. In 1982, Humulin, an insulin growth
            from E. coli, hit the market after being approved by the FDA.
            Humulin was the very first genetically modified product sold to
            humans. The Flavr Savr tomato followed Humulin’s example, being the
            first genetically modified food to be sold in grocery stores in
            1994. The DNA of the Flavr Savr tomato was modified to delay
            ripening on the shelf and enhance the tomato’s red color to attract
            more customers. GMOs dominated the United States food market by the
            year 1999. (1)</p>
          <p>Some may argue we’ve been using GMOs for years due to
            crossbreeding, but the process of crossbreeding versus the process
            of creating a genetically modified plant is incredibly different.
            Crossbreeding, by definition, is breeding individuals, related or
            non-related, to attain new properties. This is often achieved by
            cross-pollination, something that happens often and regularly in
            nature. Crossbreeding has been used to create a variety of fruits we
            eat today, such as oranges, grapefruit, carambola, and dragonfruit.
            GMOs differentiate from crossbreeding in multiple ways. When a
            scientist wishes for food to sport a new quality, they often extract
            this quality from the DNA of a virus, bacteria (e.g. E. coli),
            animals, or, most surprisingly, humans. Once that target has been
            extracted from the donor, they place it on a fleck of gold. The
            fleck of gold with DNA is placed in a machine called a “gene gun”.
            With extreme amounts of power and force, the gold is aimed and shot
            directly into the nucleus of the receiving plant. If the blow is not
            strong enough, the gold will not penetrate the cell wall of the
            plant. If the blow is forceful enough, the plant will absorb and
            break down the gold, and the scientist can only hope that the DNA
            will bond with the plant’s current DNA. After this, the scientists
            go through bouts of growing and testing the seeds to see which
            absorbed the donor gene and which ones failed. (2)</p>
          <p>Another way in which GMOs are altered is through a process with
            bacteria, called Agrobacterium. Agrobacterium is a parasitic
            organism that, in its natural habitat, creates crown-gall disease in
            plants--abnormal growths that look like tumors. Agrobacterium
            injects a type of plasmid that contains special DNA that “recodes”
            the plant to produce food for the parasite. This trait of injecting
            DNA into a plant was needed for genetic engineering, and with that,
            it has become a crucial tool in the biotech industry. Agrobacterium
            is given the donor gene that a scientist wants to implant within a
            seed. Next, the Agrobacterium implants itself into the cell and
            transfers the DNA. Along with the donor gene is an
            antibiotic-resistant gene, which allows scientists to treat the
            plants with antibiotics once they are grown. The plants that survive
            the antibiotics have successfully adopted the new genes into their
            genome, and the plants that die have failed to absorb the new gene.
            (3) GMOs are created very differently than crossbreeding, and it is
            an important distinction to understand in the discussion of
            genetically modified foods.</p>
          <p>Another type of GMO crop is called “RoundUp Ready”, or Bt crops.
            These crops contain a parasitic bacterial gene, Bacillus
            Thuringiensis, that produces pesticides and insecticides inside of
            the plant, so farmers do not have to use as much insecticide or
            pesticide on the outside of the plant. Pro-Bt activists claim that
            this reduces the need for producing insecticide and pesticide and
            enhances the efficiency of genetically modified farming, creating
            less work for the farmer to fend off the pests eating his or her
            crop. This is concerning for a number of reasons, the main reason
            being that we are ingesting the insecticides inside of our food.</p>
          <p>Studies with GMOs are controversial on both sides of the argument.
            Anti-GMO activists claim that GMOs can cause long term fatal
            diseases, cancer, and even change your own DNA. Pro-GMO activists
            and biotech companies say nothing of the sort, reassuring that this
            technology is completely safe for humans; but the FDA regulates GMOs
            with the same procedures as conventional food, which can lead to
            missed details. (59) First, I will look at studies directly dealing
            with the effects of genetically modifying the plant itself, and
            next, at studies that deal with effects of the herbicides used on
            top of and produced inside of the plants.<br>
            With the non-natural process that genetically modified plants are
            created (e.g. In a lab, other than in nature), it is unwise to
            assume that no side effects will come of this forced change in the
            genome. A long-term study of 22.7 weeks was completed on commercial
            pigs. Equal number of male and female pigs were present; female pigs
            were split into two groups, as were the male, and one group in both
            male and female were fed GM-feed (genetically modified feed), and
            the other groups were fed non-GM feed. After the test completed and
            the pig’s lives ran their course, the organs were weighed and
            studied. The uteri, uterus, in female pigs fed GM-crop were 25%
            heavier than the females fed non-GM crop. There was a significant
            spike in stomach inflammation in the GM-fed pigs, with a height of
            32% rate of inflammation instead of the non-GM fed 12% rate. (13)
            While human stomachs and uteri are not the same as a pig’s, the fact
            that the rate of stomach inflammation increased so dramatically is
            something to watch closely and observe in humans.</p>
          <p>Scientists from the Journal of Reproductive Toxicology performed a
            study on pregnant and non-pregnant women’s blood, concerning Bt
            “RoundUp ready” crops. It states, “ To our knowledge, this is the
            first study to highlight the presence of pesticides-associated
            genetically modified foods in maternal, fetal and nonpregnant
            women’s blood. 3-MPPA and Cry1Ab [pesticide identifiers] toxin are
            clearly detectable and appear to cross the placenta to the fetus.
            Given the potential toxicity of these environmental pollutants and
            the fragility of the fetus, more studies are needed, particularly
            those using the placental transfer approach.” (14) This means that
            RoundUp and toxic pest-controlling pesticide produced within the Bt
            genetically modified crop have been found in our blood. If traces
            are in our blood and are being passed down into children, that can
            possibly affect the way the children grow and develop. Because of
            the unknown implications of these toxic chemicals to an unborn baby,
            this is a huge concern to those who wish to live healthy lives and
            have healthy children. Like the study said, this situation requires
            more studies to be done, but its data needs to be strongly
            considered.</p>
          <p>In a Chinese study, a large group of scientists performed a study
            that demonstrated an interesting discovery with miRNA (microRNA).
            MicroRNA is classified as a non-coding RNA, meaning it’s shorter
            than the usual RNA found in our bodies, and it isn’t translated by
            the body as a protein. Good and healthy miRNA are typically obtained
            orally through the food we eat. With their studies in vitro and in
            vivo (the plant cells cultivated in a lab, and the plant as a
            whole), the miRNA of the plants “could bind to the human/mouse
            low-density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein 1 (LDLRAP1) mRNA,
            inhibit LDLRAP1 expression in liver, and consequently decrease LDL
            removal from mouse plasma”. (15) Translating this to more
            understandable terms, this means they’ve found the microRNA of
            plants within the tissues of mammals, and have proven that mammals
            can consume plants and the miRNA can be absorbed into the tissues
            and have it affect their body. With this information, it is
            hypothesized that genetically modified organisms could have the
            ability to mimic hormones and other functions in the body, replacing
            our own. This effect has been proven with chemicals in household
            products and pollution in our environment, creating endocrine
            disruption in men, women, and children around the world. (60) If
            this effect can be proven with food, these synthetics could affect
            hormones like the adrenals, thyroid, pancreas, and reproductive
            hormones. While this is hypothesized, it is a solid reason to
            encourage more scientific studies on the effects of GMOs in the
            body, and to fully understand what is happening when we eat them in
            our food.</p>
          <p>When transferring a new gene into a plant, often one of the genes
            used is an antibiotic resistant quality. To test which plants
            accepted the new gene, scientists treat the plant tissues with
            antibiotics. Those that survive successfully accepted the new gene,
            and the ones that die do not survive the antibiotics. Through a
            process called horizontal gene transfer, scientists have speculated
            that antibiotic resistant genes latch onto our small intestinal
            tract, which is a possible explanation for the increase in recent
            antibiotic resistance. (16, 18) A study in the European union
            concluded, “ the acquisition of new genes, such as antibiotic
            resistance genes from plant to environmental bacteria, might be
            possible”. (17) Multiple studies presented in an open letter to the
            European Food Safety Authority confirmed that horizontal gene
            transfer occurs in numerous situations. To quote part of the letter:<br>
            “The report constantly alludes to ‘natural transformation’ to
            emphasize the increasingly accepted notion that horizontal gene
            transfer is part of the amazing feats of ‘natural genetic
            engineering’ (19) or ‘natural genetic modification’ (20) that
            organisms and cells carry out in order to survive (21). However,
            there is nothing ‘natural’ about GM nucleic acids, which contain
            numerous synthetic parts [foreign genes] and novel combinations, and
            are designed to overcome and override natural genetic modification
            processes. Nevertheless, GM nucleic acids can exploit natural
            transformation processes to wreak potential havoc on health and the
            environment (20). There is already evidence that short, degraded DNA
            is readily taken up by human cells and integrated into the genome,
            that nucleic acids are actively secreted by cells into the
            circulatory system, and nucleic acids in food can enter the
            bloodstream and influence gene expression in cells of the body [see
            (21)].” The rise in antibiotic resistance has multiple things at
            play, and this is a major constituent.</p>
          <p>It is almost impossible to to talk about GMOs without mention of
            the biggest herbicide on the market, RoundUp. The RoundUp herbicide
            main ingredient, glyphosate, was discovered in 1980, when the
            company Monsanto was reaching it’s bankruptcy from hundreds of
            lawsuits (22). The discovery of this herbicide saved the company and
            has rocketed it forward as a billion dollar industry. By genetically
            engineering plants to resist glyphosate, farmers could dump tons of
            RoundUp on their plants to kill all surrounding weeds and plants
            without fear of harming their crop. Even though it has “herb” in the
            name does not classify a chemical as “safe”. Glyphosate is a
            chemical that targets the metabolic function of an organism’s cells.
            Once the target is found, glyphosate prevents the organism from
            metabolising--producing food--and kills the life form. RoundUp
            resistant crops are sprayed frequently throughout the growth process
            and doused once more after harvest to dry up the crop.</p>
          <p>Glyphosate is proclaimed as safe, yet it has been detected in the
            urine and organs of animals and humans (23). One study found animals
            fed in open grass pastures had significantly lower levels of
            glyphosate in their system as opposed to their GM-fed counterparts.
            In another study, humans who were chronically ill had a significant
            jump of glyphosate in their urine as opposed to those deemed as
            “healthy”. There have been studies showing that glyphosate stands as
            an endocrine disruptor in our system (24, 25) and altered certain
            expressions of DNA (24). RoundUp as a whole was tested and found to
            act as an estrogen synthesis in placental and endocrine systems
            (26), which means RoundUp stood in as a synthetic estrogen hormone
            in the placenta, as well as when sending signals around the
            endocrine hormone system. There are hundreds more studies like so,
            and they are all being ignored. If glyphosate is so called “safe”,
            then studies like this would back up that claim.</p>
          <p>In their entirety, GMOs are like the ocean, massive and extensive,
            and we know so little about them even with the thousands of studies
            performed. There are few checks and balances that restrict public
            exposure to their influence. GMOs are contradictory from many
            perspectives, so much so that over three hundred scientists have
            agreed and signed a consensus that there are not enough clarified
            studies on genetically modified organisms, therefore settling the
            fact that they are neither safe or unsafe. (27) Multiple studies
            concluded that there needs to be more research done on the subtle
            effects of GMOs (28), and others have pointed out that many of the
            studies that claim genetically modified food safe have been
            performed by the biotech companies themselves. (29) This is a
            question of whether or not these companies are worth trusting and
            what their incentive is for making such statements of safety.</p>
          <p>Expanding our view of genetically engineering to a bigger
            perspective, the environment is the house that holds them and grows
            them, but are they benefiting the environment as much as the
            environment is benefiting them?</p>
          <p>Since GMOs hit the market, an increase in herbicide use has not
            only killed the weeds farmers don’t want in their fields, but
            created new species of superweeds and superpests, as the media calls
            them. These weeds are resistant to RoundUp, therefore more synthetic
            chemicals are used to kill off these weeds, which in turn means more
            chemicals are sprayed on our food every day. A study from the
            International Journal of Biotechnology published a study saying,
            “these benefits [of using Bt crops] have been eroded by increasing
            the use of pesticides aimed to control secondary pests”. (47) One of
            the original claims of using GMOs was to reduce pesticide usage.
            This has not only failed to follow through, but we’re using less
            pesticides and more herbicides in attempt to control these monster
            weeds. If this train stays on the tracks, it is likely that weeds
            will become resistant to the majority of chemicals we try to kill
            them with.</p>
          <p>An argument often held by pro-GMO users is that GMO crops yield
            much more than conventional and organic crops ever could, which aid
            us in solving world hunger. Crop yield for GMO seeds is only larger
            because the seeds have the ability to be grown closer together. In
            the elder years of farming, seeds had to be grown a certain distance
            apart to leave room for farmers to till their fields to prevent
            weeds. With RoundUp, this is no longer a concern, it kills weeds
            wherever they are. This allows the seeds to be planted closer
            together, therefore more room to plant more seeds. While we may
            increase crop yield this way, a majority of the yield is not going
            to our food supply, it is going towards the production of biofuels,
            additives, preservatives, and other products. (48)</p>
          <p>An argument that claims organic farming cannot keep up with
            conventional farming is false. A study comparing the yields of
            organic farming versus conventional farming stated, “with good
            management practices, particular crop types and growing
            conditions—organic systems can thus nearly match conventional
            yields”. (49) Another study concluded, “These promising results,
            based on robust analysis of a larger meta-dataset, suggest that
            appropriate investment in agroecological research to improve organic
            management systems could greatly reduce or eliminate the yield gap
            for some crops or regions”. (50) It is imperative to consider the
            cost and labor required to farm non-GM farms as opposed to GMO
            farms, but as more research and distrust of massive biotech
            companies emerge, the demand for organic food grows larger.</p>
          <p>Soil is crucial to the growing of plants and crops. It provides the
            below-ground nutrients and minerals the plants need to survive.
            Farmers have reported that soil change has been seen when switching
            from conventional farming to biotech farming. The soil’s density
            grew hard and stiff, and the plant’s roots were short and small,
            with only few nodules. The soil from farming conventionally was soft
            and mushy, like ground coffee, and the roots were long and healthier
            looking. (52) This was checked only by uprooting plants, not
            necessarily through a study, but it is important to consider. Robert
            Kremer, a scientist from the United States Agriculture Department,
            says; “Because glyphosate moves into the soil from the plant, it
            seems to affect the rhizosphere, the ecology around the root zone,
            which in turn can affect plant health.” Kremer has studied the
            effects of glyphosate on soybeans for many years. (53)</p>
          <p>The idea that science and technology and chemicals are the only way
            to continue farming to keep up with the population is a tainted
            argument. Organic farming is capable of keeping up with conventional
            yields, while genetically modified foods and the way they are
            chemically treated are harming and contaminating the soil they’re
            grown in. As a professor and researcher at Berkeley Institute says,
            “We simply can’t continue to produce food far into the future
            without taking care of our soils, water and biodiversity.” (51)</p>
          <p>One of the biggest overseas debates about genetic modification
            concerns golden rice. Golden rice sports genes from daffodil and
            bacteria that causes it to produce beta carotene, or vitamin A. It
            was created for those in the Philippines, Asia, and Africa who are
            deficient in vitamin A, the deficiency causing a weakened immune
            system and blindness in millions of people each year. Unfortunately,
            test results for this product have been sporadic. Glenn Stone, a
            researcher of golden rice since 2013, said, “The rice simply has not
            been successful in test plots of the rice breeding institutes in the
            Philippines, where the leading research is being done,” Stone said.
            “It has not even been submitted for approval to the regulatory
            agency, the Philippine Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI)”. (7)</p>
          <p>While the idea of golden rice was a noble one, many Asian farmers
            have protested against growing golden rice themselves. Not only have
            farmers protested, but doctors and leaders of big companies in
            Bangladesh, Indonesia, Asia, and the Philippines. (5) Considering
            the health, testing, and economic trials and errors with this
            product, there are much easier and cheaper ways to provide vitamin A
            to those in third world countries, such as food fortification (in
            flours and sugars) or supplements.</p>
          <p>Around the world, labeling of GMOs is mandatory in sixty-four
            different countries including the European Union, Japan, Russia, and
            Australia. The United States, Canada, and some others have no rules
            for labeling anything genetically modified. (4) Monsanto, the
            biggest biotech company in the industry, claims on their website,
            “We don’t support mandatory labeling of GMOs, as we believe it will
            leave consumers confused about the safety and nutrition of the foods
            they enjoy every day.” (6) In another answered question on their
            website, Monsanto says, “We have historically opposed state-by-state
            initiatives to mandate labeling of ingredients developed from GM
            seeds in the absence of any demonstrated risks. Such labeling
            creates a confusing and costly patchwork of state laws. However, we
            are one of over 1,100 food and agriculture organizations that
            support the bipartisan national legislative agreement on GMO
            labeling that passed approval in the U.S. Senate and House of
            Representatives in July 2016. We understand that consumers want to
            know more about their food and believe this framework will provide
            consistency in access to information about the use of GMOs in the
            food system across the country.” (9) Clearly, these two answers
            contradict each other. Monsanto has spent millions of dollars
            preventing states from passing labeling laws, but they haven’t made
            any moves to start labeling genetically modified food nationally,
            which they “support”. Labeling will not confuse consumers. Labeling
            will initiate curiosity and research, to allow us to become more
            educated about a subject like genetic engineering and what kind of
            food we are putting into our bodies.</p>
          <p>Another argument made against labeling GMOs is the fact that it is
            much too expensive for companies and farmers to uphold. In many
            economic studies, it has been predicted that consumer food prices
            will not change (10), it would estimatedly cost less than a penny
            per person per day to put a GMO label on a package of food (11), and
            studies that say otherwise have previously been based on faulty
            assumptions. If Monsanto can spend millions of dollars a month
            promoting no labels, it is contradictory to assume they cannot pay
            for labeling GMO food. (12)</p>
          <p>Organic food can be a pricey choice for some people’s budgets
            compared to the cheaper conventional and GMO foods we’ve gotten used
            to. Some claim this is because organic food farmers are just trying
            to make a profit and there is no difference between the two kinds of
            farming. Looking at the economical standpoint of farming GMO and
            conventional versus organic, there was a study published in the
            Journal of Agronomy which determined that, over time, organic
            farming created more of a profit for the farmer and produced enough
            crop demand for the market. (57) While GMO is cheaper and easier to
            buy, this doesn’t mean it’s the correct and healthy choice. Another
            Institute talked with Ed Fry, “who farms 400 acres of grain and has
            240 milk cows in Chestertown, Md., points out in a marketing fact
            sheet from Rodale that while his corn yields were comparable in
            2000, his total production costs were lower for organic corn -
            $1.79/bushel versus $2.23 for conventional. The labor per acre was
            higher in his organic corn, but because the organic corn fetched $4
            a bushel versus $2.50 for the conventional, he didn't need to farm
            as many acres for the same amount of profit.” (58)</p>
          <p>Monsanto has patented over 14,000 things, from seeds to chemicals
            to machines and processes. (54) They make millions of dollars from
            these patents on their seeds and chemicals every year. Recently,
            Monsanto has been suing farmers to protect their patents resulting
            in large court cases and complicated affairs.. The CFS (Center for
            Food Safety) traced back over 142 patent infringement lawsuits
            against 56 small businesses and 410 farmers, which have resulted in
            over $23 million pay for Monsanto. (55) Dave Murphy, executive
            director of Food Democracy Now, says, “If Monsanto can patent seeds
            for financial gain, they should be forced to pay for contaminating a
            farmer’s field, not be allowed to sue them.” (56) Field
            contamination often occurs with pollination and wind, which creates
            strife for farmers who have their own fields close to other farmers
            who have GMO plots nearby.</p>
          <p>GMOs are not solving the issue of world hunger. Many of the
            mass-produced genetically modified crops such as corn, soybeans,
            their yields are split between going into the food supply and being
            turned into fuel, preservatives, additives, and more. The issue of
            labeling ties into another issue of deporting food from the U.S.A.,
            many countries do not want to eat our food, so they refuse to take
            it, or they have strict regulations on labeling it before allowing
            it to enter their country. Preventing starvation in the United
            States has had no studies done to prove it’s working. To acquire the
            food, these starving and poor people have to buy the food, which
            they are unable to do. World Starvation is not a lack-of-food issue,
            it is an economic and government issue.</p>
          <p>Economics play a huge part in the farming, manufacturing, and
            sustaining of genetically modified foods. It takes an extensive
            amount for Monsanto itself to keep its patents in control, and much
            more expense for the farmers to keep up with the technology. Between
            the crops, land, and increasing use of pesticides and herbicides due
            to superweeds and pests, it will be interesting to see if genetic
            engineered farming will be able to keep up the way it is now.</p>
          <p>The largest biotech company that patented Bt seeds and produces
            RoundUp is the company Monsanto. Monsanto began back in 1901 as a
            chemical company that produced artificial sweeteners. They also
            designed the chemical that is featured in aspirin and rubber
            catalyzers. In 1920, Monsanto created and produced a hugely toxic
            chemical, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl). PCBs are proven
            carcinogens and pollutants, which back then were used as a liquid
            cooling system for electrical capacitors and power transformers.
            Monsanto was the only United States producer of PCBs until the
            chemical was banned by the government in 1979. A large court case
            occured due to Monsanto’s hidden knowledge about the toxicity of
            PCBs, they knew ten years before the product was ever banned. In
            1939, Monsanto was contracted with the government as its primary
            chemical supplier. They were crucial to the design of the
            polonium-based initiators used in the two atomic bombs the United
            States dropped on Japan during World War II. After the war had
            ended, Monsanto transferred their business to agriculture,
            developing one of the most toxic pesticides, DDT
            (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane). DDT was banned no less than
            thirty years later because of its dire health effects. Moving on,
            Monsanto developed Agent Orange, a defoliant that successfully
            killed plants. Agent Orange was a weapon used by the government
            during Operation Ranch Hand in the Vietnam War. Agent Orange
            successfully deteriorated and destroyed the farms, food, and land in
            Vietnam, preventing farmers from growing crops during the war. To
            those exposed to Agent Orange, it caused horrible birth defects in
            the children born to the mothers, infecting over three million
            people and half the babies born in the following years. In 1970,
            Monsanto attempted to move on from chemicals, developing and mass
            producing LED (light-emitting diode) lights that are found in much
            of the technology we have today. During this time, the government
            banned all of the chemicals and pesticides and herbicides created by
            Monsanto due to their extreme toxicity. Because of this, Monsanto’s
            revenue plummeted, the company received hundreds of lawsuits, and
            the company was reaching the point of bankruptcy. At this point
            Monsanto’s executives made the decision to return the company’s
            focus to agriculture and biotechnology, which was a brand new
            science in the 1980s. One of Monsanto’s scientists, Robert Fraley,
            became the first to successfully genetically engineer a plant.
            Around this time period, they discovered glyphosate, and immediately
            turned around to market it as an herbicide under the name of
            RoundUp. They followed the process of genetically engineering their
            seeds to avoid being killed by glyphosate, and offered those to
            farmers as the first GMO seeds. Glyphosate and GMOs soon became the
            most widely used products in agriculture in two decades. (30)</p>
          <p>In an attempt to hide their chemical industry history, Monsanto
            created a company name called Solutia, which was an attempt at
            washing their hands of their morally questionable past in the
            chemical industry, creating and deploying carcinogenic and
            disruptive chemicals into the world. Solutia inherited all of
            Monsanto’s lawsuits and litigations, but in 2003, Solutia filed for
            bankruptcy. The Eastman Chemical company bought Solutia during this
            time, and the rest was forgotten. (30)</p>
          <p>When Monsanto was new to the biotech industry and wanting to
            promote GMO foods into the market, they went directly to the
            government and negotiated strongly with them, resulting in
            regulations they wanted confirmed. “Government guidelines, the
            executives reasoned, would reassure a public that was growing
            skittish about the safety of this radical new science.” They were
            very arrogant about this new food, which caused the process to run
            too fast. (31)</p>
          <p>In 1999, the European Union revolted so strongly about the imported
            United States genetically modified food that Monsanto’s revenues of
            deporting food dropped extremely. To save their company once more,
            they merged with a pharmaceutical company, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn.
            This extended their branch of products, and introduced a whole new
            level to their company. (31)</p>
          <p>To our knowledge, there have been at least seven Monsanto employees
            that are now in high ranking positions in the FDA. The most
            influential man’s name is Michael R. Taylor, who currently holds the
            position of deputy commissioner of the Office of Foods. In the
            1990s, he held the FDA position of deputy commissioner for Policy.
            In the middle of those two jobs, he took up role as Vice President
            of Public Policy in Monsanto. The rBGH beef growth hormone was in
            production at the time, and when Mr. Taylor left Monsanto for the
            position at the FDA, he was one of the authorities managing labeling
            guidelines for rBGH, which could have potentially lead to a conflict
            of interest. People in the same situation include Margaret Miller,
            who was a scientist at Monsanto that helped develop this growth
            hormone. She holds the position of deputy director of New Animal
            Drugs in the FDA. There are many others worth mentioning such as
            Arthur Hayes, Michael A. Friedman, and Virginia Weldon. These
            workers are potentially a larger influence in the FDA, making
            decisions against labeling and accepting new technology into our
            food supply. (37)</p>
          <p>We may demand and ask for more studies on Monsanto’s genetically
            modified seeds, but this feat can become difficult with the legal
            rules the company has set up for their seeds. In the user agreement,
            the column “Grower Agrees:”, section J, states, “Grower may not
            plant and may not transfer to others for planting any Seed that the
            Grower has produced containing patented Monsanto Technologies for
            crop breeding, research, or generation of herbicide registration
            data. Grower may not conduct research on Grower’s crop produced from
            Seed other than to make agronomic comparisons and conduct yield
            testing for Grower’s own use. Monsanto makes available separate
            license agreements to academic institutions for research.” This
            entails the only people allowed to research and test the GMO seeds
            are universities that are granted a license by Monsanto, which in
            turn means that they can pick and choose between universities and
            whether or not they are granted the legal rights to study these
            crops and seeds.</p>
          <p>Those that are able to obtain seeds and test subjects for research
            have to be careful about their jobs:<br>
            ‘It’s very strange: whenever scientists have decided to start a
            serious toxicological study on the effects of GMOs, they have lost
            their jobs. This happened to the biochemist Arpad Pusztai in
            Scotland and Manuela Malatesta when she was a researcher at the
            University of Urbino. It is a recurring phenomenon. It is alarming,
            people wonder, what will happen to me? Monsanto has silenced
            academics, journalists and anyone who has ventured to criticize or
            expose them. That’s why I say there is a real problem with GMOs,
            otherwise there would be transparent and accessible studies.’
            (Anniversary of a Whistleblowing Hero” by Jeffrey Smith, Huffington
            Post, 2010)”</p>
          <p>The only studies coming out about the safety of GMOs are the
            studies that GMO companies have approved and even conducted
            themselves (34). Independent studies confirming the safety of GMOs
            have bouts of conflict of interests involved, where one or more of
            the authors have been employees of the biotech seed companies. (35,
            36)</p>
          <p>In November of 2017, Carey Gillam, an investigative journalist,
            presented to the European Parliament a slough of internal emails
            demonstrating the dealings of Monsanto and their executives.(38, 46)
            These emails contained information dealing with the safety of GMOs
            and glyphosate: “We cannot support the statement about "no adverse
            effects whatsoever on flora, or fauna or on the human body". Adverse
            effects are seen on flora (glyphosate is meant to kill vegetation),
            adverse effects on fauna - in studies with laboratory animals - even
            death is seen (LDS0 studies for example) and in humans - mild
            reversible eye and skin irritation are seen with normal use and
            death can occur in suicide attempts.” This was a quote from Donna
            Farmer, Manager of Toxicology Programs for Monsanto.</p>
          <p>These emails revealed removing and preventing studies and
            scientists from appearing(41), giving money to the government to
            prevent labeling of GMOs (e.g. treasury receipts for billions of
            dollars (39)), and more. There were emails documenting the
            copy-and-pasted actions of faked studies by Monsanto, then using
            names of scientists who never performed the study as authors of
            their papers (42, 43), “An option would be to add Greim and Kier or
            Kirkland to have their names on the publication, but we would be
            keeping the cost down by us doing the writing and they would just
            edit &amp; sign their names so to speak. Recall that is how we
            handled Williams Kroes &amp; Munro, 2000.” (44, 45) With
            ghostwritten studies, retracted evidence, lying behind the public’s
            back, only to sell food and make a profit, Monsanto is a company
            that is not to be trusted.</p>
          <p>GMOs are unnaturally made by crossing animal and plant kingdoms
            that does not occur in nature, which I believe is wrong. I believe
            we do not need to tamper with God’s creation to fulfill a predicted
            need of food, when we are capable enough to farm the way we have for
            years. While this belief may not be a popular one and biotech
            companies control the industry, I think the best way to combat their
            control and attempts to dominate the food and farming industry is to
            support the local farmers, the organic foods at your local grocery
            store, and stay knowledgeable about topics such as GMOs; to support
            initiatives and legislation which create accountability, enforce
            transparency for biotech companies such as Monsanto, and to protect
            human and environmental health. It is unwise to trust one massive,
            multi-billion dollar company to our entire food supply, when this
            company has been a producer of hazardous chemicals in the past. We
            can’t trust the way they’ve made decisions, kept secrets about
            toxicity of products in the past, and secretly maneuvered through
            convincing people of safety with internal emails and retracted
            studies. It is neither scientifically nor morally correct.</p>
