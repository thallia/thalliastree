          <p>Good Morning, all!</p>
          <p>It's not really morning, but I like that greeting.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">This past week has been filled with crazy
            excitement and many new things! I received two awesome packages
            filled with electronic components such as logic gates, cords, jumper
            wires, LEDs, RGB LEDs, resistors, and a breadboard. I couldn't wait
            to start working with a breadboard for the first time.</p>

          <span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;"></span>
          <p style="margin-left: -12px; width: 845px;"><br>
          </p>
          <p>My beginner storage is pretty good for now, but I can tell I'm
            going to fill it pretty quick and will have to upgrade to something
            else soon.</p>
          <p>The first thing I did was find a guide on how to set up an LED on a
            breadboard and found <a href="https://startingelectronics.org/beginners/start-electronics-now/tut1-breadboard-circuits/"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">this great article</a>. To say I
            was ecstatic when I built my first circuit was an understatement.<br>
            <img src="../images/first-circuit.jpg" alt="" title="first circuit"><br>
            I figured you could put multiple LEDs in a row, because that's just
            a bunch of resistors in parallel and it would work, so I played
            around and got a happy rainbow:</p>
          <img src="file:///home/thallia/thalliastree/images/first-rainbow-circuit.jpg"
            alt="" title="first rainbow circuit"><br>
          I <em>did</em> learn that breadboard wire links are the same as
          jumper wires, they're just specially sized for different purposes.<br>
          In my package I received an RGB LED (common cathode) as well, which is
          a Light Emitting Diode that has a Red, Green, and Blue LED in it, and
          it can make multiple different colors depending on the intensity of
          each LED. I had no idea how to get it to change colors, so I pulled
          out my Raspberry Pi for the first time and started experimenting, as I
          knew there were ways to get an RGB to work with a Pi.</div>
        <div style="width: 745px;"><img src="file:///home/thallia/thalliastree/images/tv-rpi-monitor.jpg"
            alt="" title="tv rpi monitor"><br>
          <p>My parents were a bit shocked when they came out and saw I had
            turned the TV into a monitor, but I assured them it was okay and I
            wasn't going to break the TV with my programming.</p>
          <p>I didn't have a usb mouse to connect to my Pi, but I did have a
            nice <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LINGBAO-JIGUANSHI-Mechanical-Backlight-Anti-ghosting/dp/B01MYGA7WQ/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497735237&amp;sr=8-13&amp;keywords=mechanical%2Bkeyboard%2Bbacklit%2Bantighosting%2Bblue%2Bswitch&amp;th=1">mechanical
              keyboard</a> that I got to highlight the desktop apps, which,
            fortunately, one of them was a terminal. (I <em>love</em>
            terminals.) I got the terminal up and running, next I needed to get
            the RGB LED hooked up to the breadboard and then connect the
            breadboard to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi.</p>
          <p>With this picture, I got the general idea of how to set up the
            wires in the breadboard and connect them to the Pi:<br>
            <img src="../images/rpi-rgb-wiring.jpg" alt="" title="rpi rgb wiring"><br>
            I must admit, it took me way too long to figure out that I had a
            Raspberry Pi 1, not a Raspberry Pi 2. Heh. Once I discovered that, I
            could effectively attach my jumper wires to the appropriate GPIO
            pins on the Pi, using this diagram:</p>
          <img src="../images/rpi-1-gpio-pinout.jpg" alt="" title="rpi 1 gpio pinout"></div>
        <div style="width: 745px;">
          <p style="margin-left: -12px; width: 845px;">The code I used required
            me to attach my cathode (the longest pin) to pin 6, GROUND. The RED
            pin I attached to GPIO 12, GREEN I attached to GPIO 16, and BLUE to
            GPIO 18. Here's a picture of it all set up (from two different
            angles).</p>
          <img src="../images/rpi-rgb-circuit-setup.jpg" alt="" title="rpi rgb circuit setup"></div>
        <div style="width: 745px;">
          <p>Once I connected the wires right, I could start finding code to get
            this LED to work. After searching for code that worked with a Raspi
            1, I stumbled upon this website by a guy named <b><a href="http://www.henryleach.com/2013/05/controlling-rgb-led-with-raspberry-pi.html">Henry
                Leach</a></b>. Boy, was I glad to find his post. He showed his
            calculations about resistors and picking the right values to get the
            brightest colors, and then nicely shared his code that cycled
            through a variety of colors with his LED.</p>
          <p>I don't know anything about Python (yet), but I went with it
            because I wanted to get this thing working. I typed in all the code
            (which was painstaking, because I use a dvorak keyboard layout, but
            it was in US on the Pi. That took a while...) into the terminal text
            editor, nano. To get there, I opened a terminal and executed <code>nano
              rgb.py<br>
            </code></p>
          <img src="../images/rgb-pi-code.jpg" alt="" title="rpi rgb code"></div>
        <div style="width: 745px;">Once I finished typing that all out, I
          assumed IDLE was a Python Shell, so in a terminal I executed <code>idle</code>
          . From my experience with a Forth terminal, I knew if you wanted the
          code to be used in that session you had to use <code>include
            filename.fth</code> to use your code within the shell. I assumed <code>import</code>
          did the same thing, and viola, it worked! I had some syntax errors but
          once I fixed those and ran the program, I got a wonderful result:<br>
          <video src="../images/rgb-first-run.mp4" preload="none" controls="controls"></video></div>
        <div style="width: 745px;">
          <p>I think the lights were a bit shaky at certain colors because I
            only had 1k Ohm resistors, so once I get my package of 30 different
            types of resistors today in the mail I'm going to try this project
            again to see if it makes a difference.</p>
          <p>Now my goal is to replicate this in C code, as I'm going to learn
            it. After that, I'm going to attempt to get the LED to change colors
            and respond based on the waveforms of music that is playing, and
            eventually put this tech in the laminar water fountain I'm building
            with my friend.</p>
          <p>I'll put a post up about the fountain soon, we just bought the
            first installment of the supplies and materials, and once we start
            building it I'll put up a tutorial type post.</p>
          <p>Before I wrap up this post, in other news, I received a mandolin
            from my Nana as an early birthday present and I couldn't be more
            excited!<br>

        <p>I've been teaching myself some scales, and I'm working on the <b><a
              href="https://youtu.be/w6lCwQs6_sM">Irish Washerwoman</a></b>
          melody picking. I'm thinking of naming it Henry. What do you all
          think? :)</p>
