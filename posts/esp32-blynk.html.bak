              Raspberry Pi IRC Server <br>
            </span></h2>
          <span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;"></span>
          <p style="width: 746px;">As UTW is growing, we're getting closer and
            closer to using a better platform for chatting (we've been using
            Discord up to this point, which has been fantastic). To get practice
            in networking ideas and to use my old Raspberry Pi B+, I decided to
            set up a small IRC server.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">I found this tutorial at Pi My Life Up: <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-irc-server/">https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-irc-server/</a></p>
          <p style="width: 749px;">It covered the basics, but not <em>all</em>
            of them, so I thought I'd make a tutorial and document what I've
            done as well.</p>
          <p>As always, I started with <code>sudo apt-get update</code> and <code>sudo
              apt-get upgrade</code>.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">Next, I installed a software called <a href="http://www.ircd-hybrid.org/">Ircd-Hybrid</a>,
            â€œA lightweight, high-performance internet relay chat daemon".
            Perfect for the raspberry pi!</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">The next step requires you to make a
            password, and have something to copy/paste it, or have something to
            write it down.<br>
            Using <code>/usr/bin/mkpasswd password</code>, replace "password"
            with your preferred and secret password, hit enter, and it should
            return an encrypted, scrambled version of your password. COPY AND
            SAVE THIS, we'll need it later!</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Next you have to configure what you actually
            want your server to do, say, be named, etc. To access the
            configuration file, run:</p>
          <p><code>sudo nano /etc/ircd-hybrid/ircd.conf</code></p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">There's a <em>lot</em> to look at in this
            config. It overwhelmed me at first, but as long as you take it one
            block at a time, it's fairly easy to understand.</p>
          <p>In the first block, <strong>serverinfo {</strong>, find the first
            line:</p>
          <p><code>name = "hybrid8.debian.local";</code></p>
          <p>And change it to:</p>
          <p><code>name = "underthewire.irc";</code></p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">In my case, I changed the name to Under the
            Wire, since that's the name of our group. You can change it to
            whatever name you wish :)</p>
          <p>Next, find:</p>
          <p><code>description = "ircd-hybrid 8.1-debian";</code></p>
          <p>And change it to be similar to this:</p>
          <p><code>description = "Raspberry Pi UTW IRC Server";</code></p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">This is the description of what the server
            is, and it'll display this when you connect to the server in your
            IRC client (I use weechat).</p>
          <p>Find:</p>
          <p><code>network_name = "debian";<br>
              network_desc = "This is My Network";</code></p>
          <p>Replace with:</p>
          <p><code>network_name = "underthewire";<br>
              network_desc = "This is the unofficial test run UTW IRC Server";</code></p>
          <p>This describes the network that your server is going to run on.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Now skip down past the <code>admin</code>, <code>log</code>,
            and <code>class</code> blocks until you find the <code>listen</code>
            block.</p>
          <p>In <code>listen</code>, change the <code>host</code> line to your
            local IP address.</p>
          <p>Next, find the <code>auth</code> block.<br>
            in:<br>
            <code>user = "*@127.0.0.1";</code></p>
          <p>You can replace it with:<br>
            <code>user = "*@*";</code><br>
            to allow all IP addresses to be able to access the server.</p>
          <p>Within the <code>operator</code> block, find:</p>
          <p><code>user = "*@192.0.2.240/28";</code></p>
          <p>and change it to:</p>
          <p><code>user = "*@*";</code></p>
          <p>Finally, find the <code>password</code> line.</p>
          <p><code>password = "xxxxxxxxxxxxx";</code></p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Replace the <code>x</code>s with the
            encrypted password that you generated for your server near the
            beginning of this post.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">You should be done now, so <code>Ctrl-x</code>
            your way out, <code>y</code> to save the changes.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">Now we'll edit the MOTD file, which will
            appear to the users once they connect to your server!<br>
            Using <code>sudo nano /etc/ircd-hybrid/ircd.motd</code> to get
            there. You can delete all the contents of the file and write your
            own messages, or keep the Debian Swirl and write over the words, or
            leave it as is.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">I kept the debian swirl and wrote down the
            rules and inside jokes of our group. :)</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">After saving and exiting, run <code>sudo
              /etc/init.d/ircd-hybrid restart</code> to restart the server and
            implement all your changes.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">Connecting to the server was the challenging
            part, but it's fairly simple once you understand how to port forward
            from your router.<br>
            Since <em>I</em> am on my network, I hypothesized that I can't
            connect to the server from the public IP since I'm already <em>in</em>
            the network. But I'd still have to port forward so other people can
            join with my public IP.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">My ISP (internet service provider) is
            Xfinity/Comcast, so with a few screenshots I'll demonstrate how to
            port forward on their website.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">First, you have to find your local IP
            address, in which mine was <code>10.0.0.1</code>. If you enter your
            local IP into your browser like so:</p>
          <p><code>10.0.0.1</code></p>
          <p style="width: 745px;">It should take you to the router gateway.
            You'll be asked to login. The username default for Comcast/Xfinity
            is <code>admin</code>, and the default password is <code>password</code>.
            It took me <em>way</em> too long to figure that out...but once I
            did, I changed the default password.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">After you've logged in, it should look
            something like this on the top lefthand side:</p>
          <img src="../images/ircserver1.png" alt="" title="irc server"><br>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Click on Advanced, and the drop down menu
            will have a Port Forwarding option.</p>
          <p>That will take you to a screen that looks like this:<br>
            <img src="../images/ircserver2.png" alt="" title="irc server" style="width: 746px;"><br>
            Make sure you've clicked on <code>Enable</code>.<br>
            After that, click on <code>Add Service</code>, which will load a
            scary screen like this:<br>
            <img src="../images/ircserver3.png" alt="" title="ircserver" style="width: 747px;"></p>
          <p>For <code>Common services</code> there are many options depending
            on what your network can do, but I left it as other for my goal.</p>
          <p>The <code>Service Name</code> is where you enter a name or label
            for whatever this port forward will be used for. I wrote <code>Raspberry
              Pi UTW IRC</code>.</p>
          <p>The <code>Service Type</code> I left as TCP/UDP, because I didn't
            know for sure which one it would need. If you know for sure, you can
            choose that specific option.</p>
          <p>In <code>Server IPv4 Address</code> you place the IP address that
            points to the device the server is on. If you have a UNIX-based
            system, you can enter <code>hostname -I</code> into the terminal
            and it should return its IP address.</p>
          <p>I skipped over the Ipv6, and in the start port, <code>6667</code>
            and end port I put <code>6667</code>. That seemed to be the most
            default IRC port that I saw. Once done, click <code>save</code>,
            and you should be done! If the changes don't take effect
            immediately, a router reboot wouldn't hurt anything.</p>
          <p>Finally, we can try connecting!</p>
          <p>I use weechat as my IRC client. Connecting with that (as me), I
            ran:</p>
          <p><code>/server add nameoftheircserver local-ipaddress-of-device</code><br>
            It looked like this for me:<br>
            <code>/server add underthewire 10.0.0.xxx</code><br>
            (where the x's were numbers)</p>
          <p>Then:<br>
            <code>/connect underthewire</code><br>
            And it should run!</p>
          <p>Now if you wanted to allow other people to access the IRC server,
            the syntax looks exactly the same, but they put your <em>public</em>
            IP address in place of the local IP. You can find your public IP
            address at ipchicken.com</p>
          <p>And that's it! Super easy, I finished it in 2hrs with researching
            included. Thanks to uelen, fouric, and Gector in UTW for answering
            my questions as I was going through this project.</p>
          <p>As for next steps, I'm going to put an SSL certificate on the
            server to make it secure, and hopefully upgrade or remake a new
            server once I understand more how the process works. :)</p>
