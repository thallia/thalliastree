          <span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;"></span><br>
          <p>I was researching the other day on the ESP-WROOM-32 module I had
            bought off of eBay for my binary watch and found this lovely PDF
            about <a href="http://espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_hardware_design_guidelines_en.pdf"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardware design guidelines</a>.</p>
          <p>After looking further into it, it's a PDF about all the things you
            have to include when designing a board with it! Ack! Huge facepalm
            moment.</p>
          <p>I went back to the drawing board and researched people who have
            designed and created their own and decided to switch the brains of
            the watch to the <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-42735-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega328-328P_Datasheet.pdf"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">ATmega328P</a>, the main
            microprocessor of the Arduino. This means I can program the new
            ATMegas on a breadboard with the Arduino Uno. Super sweet, and
            handy.</p>
          <p>I was looking for a microcontroller with a deep sleep or ultra
            low-power mode so the CR1225 battery wouldn't be completely drained
            after one day. I was considering using the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC18F24J11"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIC18F24J11</a> because of its
            specific design <em>for</em> low power feature, but decided against
            it since I have a bit of a deadline for the schematic of this
            project. Not to mention I already know how to program an ATmega328P,
            and it would take a bit to learn how to program a different kind of
            microcontroller.</p>
          <p>With all that, I ordered the ATmega's, got them from DigiKey in 3
            days (really fast, I'm definitely buying parts from them again!),
            burned the bootloader and code with <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arduino as ISP</a>, and set to work
            on figuring out the I/O pins.</p>
          <p>First I had to remember what pins I used to get the program to work
            on the ESP32, and what those pins were so I could identify them on
            the ATmega. These were the pins on the ESP32 that I tested and
            confirmed work with the code I linked in <a href="https://thalliatree.wordpress.com/2018/01/01/project-hype-binary-wristwatch/">Project
              Hype: Binary Wristwatch.</a></p>
          <p><code>IO2/GPIO2</code> - <code>Output Enable</code> (pin 13 SR)</p>
          <p><code>IO4/GPIO4</code> - <code>SH_CP</code> (pin 11 SR)</p>
          <p><code>IO5/GPIO5</code> - <code>DS or Serial Data Input</code> (
            pin 14 SR)</p>
          <p><code>RXD0/GPIO3</code> - <code>ST_CP</code> (pin 12 SR)</p>
          <p><code>IO13</code> - <code>Button 1 (hrs)</code></p>
          <p><code>IO12</code> - <code>Button 2 (mins)</code></p>
          <p><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/PinMapping168" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">This</a> was an extremely helpful digital I/O chart
            that helped me identify the ATmega pins from the ESP32 guidelines.</p>
          <p>{[EDIT (feb 3rd, 2018): These are not the correct pin numbers, but
            i'm keeping them here for debugging purposes! If you would like to
            see the <em>correct</em> way to set the circuit up, please read the
            end of: <a href="https://thalliatree.wordpress.com/2018/02/04/prepping-the-atmega328p-bootloader-burn-fuse-byte-programming-and-hardware-test-binary-watch/">Prepping
              the ATmega328P: bootloader burn, fuse-byte programming, and
              hardware test | binary watch</a>]}</p>
          <p>Thanks to the chart and a pinout of the ESP32, I knew which pins to
            connect to which shift registers. (<code>ATmega</code> connected to
            <code>shift register pin</code>)</p>
          <p><code>Physical pin 6 (PCINT20/XCK/T0) PD4</code> connected to Pin
            11 (latch, or <code>SH_CP</code>)</p>
          <p><code>Physical Pin 2 (PCINT16/RXD) PD0]</code> connected to Pin 12
            (clock, or <code>ST_CP</code>)</p>
          <p><code>Physical Pin 4 (PCINT18/INT0) PD2]</code> connected to Pin 13
            (Output Enable, <code>OE</code>)</p>
          <p><code>Physical Pin 11 (PCINT21/OC0B/T1) PD5</code> connected to Pin
            14 (Serial Data Input)</p>
          <p><img class="transparent shrinkToFit" src="../images/atmega-1.jpg" width="939"
              height="672"><br>
          </p>
          <p>The appropriate pins on the shift registers and microcontrollers
            are connected to <code>​Vcc</code> or <code>GND</code>. You can
            tie Pins 11, 12, and 13 on the shift registers, as well. Finally,
            make sure that pin 9 on shift register 1 is connected to pin 14 of
            shift register 2. (You can kind of see it in my diagram.)</p>
          <p>Alright! Next step...testing this baby out.</p>
          <img src="../images/atmega-1.jpg"><br>
          <p><img src="../images/atmega-2.jpg"></p>
          <img src="../images/atmega-3.jpg">
          <p><img src="../images/atmega-4.jpg"></p>
          <p><img src="../images/atmega-5.jpg"><br>
          </p>
          <p><img src="../images/atmega-6.jpg"></p>
          And finally...adding power!<img src="../images/atmega-7.jpg"><br>
          <p>The LEDs on the left represent minutes, and the LEDs on the right
            represent minutes. Though they lit up, they didn't change every 60
            seconds as programmed. This likely means that the clock pin isn't
            being utilized. I unplugged the jumper wire connecting RXD0 and pin
            12 (ST_CP) and all of a sudden the LEDs started blinking
            irregularly. I moved around some wires and LEDs were going bonkers.</p>
          <p>Putting pressure on certain parts of the microcontroller and shift
            registers makes the LEDs react, which is downright weird.</p>
          <p>I scrapped the ATmega for the moment and used my Arduino Uno to
            test out the hardware side of the shift registers and code.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="width: 747px;"><img src="../images/atmega-8.jpg"><br>
          <p>Plugging it all together resulted in a cycle through of all the
            LEDs like normal, so it must be the pins that I'm utilizing on the
            ATmega328P. Which is cool! I wasn't entirely certain of my pinout
            correct-ness to begin with.</p>
          <p>Now that I've cornered the problem, I can find out more about how
            the pin-out works with the ATmega and understand more of the
            internals going on, then figure out the right ones.</p>
