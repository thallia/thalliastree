        <div style="width: 747px;">
          <p>Over the summer I read the book Debugging: The 9 Indispensable
            Rules For Finding the Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems by
            David Agans.</p>
          <p>The rules and processes he demonstrates in the book are thorough,
            solid, and extremely helpful when it comes to issues I've faced in
            my projects, programming, and understanding of how a computer works
            (even when I'm only reasoning through things in my head I've used
            these rules!).</p>
          <p>These rules can not only be applied to computers, but attempting to
            figure any kind of problem in general.</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rule 1:
                Understand the System</strong></span></p>
          <p>Before you attempt troubleshooting, if you understand the system
            and how it's supposed to work, reading the manual and figuring out
            the way all the pieces connect will aid you in the long run when you
            run into trouble. It'll give you a good road map to follow if you
            get lost in bugs or issues.</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rule 2: Making It
                Fail</strong></span></p>
          <p>By far the best rule I've used. Stimulate the failure, don't
            simulate it. As David Agans says, "Know that 'that' can happen." By
            making something fail over and over again, in different ways,
            perhaps generating new errors, it gives you a better feel for what's
            going on in the system.</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rule 3: Quit
                Thinking and LOOK.</strong></span></p>
          <p>Don't keep hypothesizing, look at the internals about what's<em>
              actually</em> going on. If you can literally "see" what's going
            on, it'll help you narrow down the possibilities.</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rule 4: Divide
                and Conquer</strong></span></p>
          <p>Find the range at which the bug is occurring, find the patterns,
            and allow that to help you narrow the search. As David Agans puts
            it, "If there's goo, the pipe is upstream. If there's no goo, the
            pipe is downstream."</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rule 5: Change
                ONE Thing At A Time</strong></span></p>
          <p>Another one of my favorite rules. I used this tactic in building my
            mini computer when I had to figure out which signals were coming off
            of which GPIO pins to turn on the touchscreen. If you change one
            thing, it'll aid in ruling out what's <em>not</em> causing the
            issue and help you find what <em>is.</em></p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rule 6: Keep An
                Audit Trail</strong></span></p>
          <p>This one is incredibly important. Sometimes you can't stay up until
            3am attempting to fix a bug, and when you wake up in the morning or
            come back after school, you forgot what you tried the previous day.
            Simply keeping a file in the project folder of your computer or
            writing things down on sticky notes can boost your productivity
            because you're able to remember the smaller details of the steps you
            took.</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rule 7: Check The
                Plug</strong></span></p>
          <p>If you got this far and still haven't figured it out, go back to
            the basics. Is it plugged in the right way? Did you make sure to
            recompile it before running? Start at the beginning and make sure
            all your assumptions are correct.</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rule 8: Get A
                Fresh View</strong></span></p>
          <p>Getting an outside view on an issue or error can be a lifesaver.
            Don't be too proud to ask for fresh insights or ask someone with
            more experience, they've all been where you have. "Bugs happen. Take
            pride in getting rid of them, not getting rid of them by yourself."
            ~David Agans<br>
            When doing so, provide symptoms of what's going on, don't give
            someone else your theory of why it's happening. Not only will you
            learn what's going on better, but it'll give better information to
            the person you're asking to help you.</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rule 9: If You
                Didn't Fix It, It Ain't Fixed</strong></span></p>
          <p>A bug never decides to flit away on its own. If it randomly
            disappears, something else is likely wrong. Make sure it's fixed by
            stimulating the failure, and if it isn't fixed, head back to the
            drawing board.</p>
          <p>Don't forget to take brain breaks, debugging can be ugly and
            annoying.</p>
          <p>I really enjoyed David Agan's book, there's <em>much </em>more
            content than anything I just shared. I highly recommend reading it,
            whether your a programmer, engineer, DIY-ist, even someone who just
            enjoys problem solving.</p>
          <p>happy debugging!</p>
