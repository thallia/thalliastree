              i3 Window Manager and Notification Daemon Dunst<br>
            </span></h2>
          <p>I haven't been doing a ton of super nerd things lately because of
            school and work, so I decided to play around with setting up the i3
            window manager; one, because I wanted to learn a new way to navigate
            my computer, and two, because I've been bugged to try it one too
            many times. XD</p>
          <p>So! I installed i3 with:</p>
          <p><code>sudo apt-get install i3</code></p>
          <p>Then restarted my computer. When logging back in, there should be a
            little gear icon that shows up right by the "login" button. Click on
            the gear and <code>i3</code> should be an option to choose from.</p>
          <p>A window should pop up asking what you want your $mod key to be.
            the $mod key is the key that will start <em>all</em> of your
            keybindings. i3 window manager is all about keybindings, so if you
            want a fun learning curve and hate using the mouse, this is the
            window manager for you!</p>
          <p>At first I was terrified because I couldn't figure out how to get a
            terminal set up. Then my friend advised the keybinding, <code>$mod+enter</code>.
            I had chosen the Win key as my $mod key, so it was <code>win+enter</code>.
            :)</p>
          <p>Once I had my terminal up and running, I had to fix the scaling on
            my mac with its fancy HiDPI screen. But other than that, the next
            step was to jump into the config file. The config syntax wasn't hard
            to learn, and you can find my config file here:<br>
            <a href="https://github.com/thallia/dotconfig/i3/config" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">https://github.com/thallia/dotconfig/i3/config</a></p>
          <p>As long as you can get a terminal and start working with the config
            (in spacemacs, emacs, vim, nano, whatever!) you're basically using
            i3, you just have to keep remembering the keybindings to get where
            you want to go.</p>
          <p>Configuring all the colors is so much fun. I ended up making a
            keybinding cheat sheet while I'm in the works of getting them all
            memorized.</p>
          <img src="../images/i3-cheatsheet.jpg" style="width: 746px; height: 861px;"></div>
        <div style="width: 747px;">
          <p>I've found so far that in some cases I like working in tiled setup
            (when working on coding projects) and fullscreen+tabbed in
            day-to-day usage. :)</p>
          <p>If you have trouble maneuvering around and starting programs, I'd
            recommend installing rofi and binding it to a comfortable keybinding
            position (mine is Control+space). Rofi is like dmenu, but much
            prettier. It'll pop up and allow you to execute programs like
            firefox, screenshot, and more, all without touching the mouse, which
            I appreciate.</p>
          <p>I wasn't fond of the notifications in i3, so I took to the
            interwebs and found <a href="https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dunst</a>. Dunst is a cool little
            notification daemon that you can use to replace the default i3
            daemon, plus it's configurable! *laughs maniacally*</p>
          <p>You can get dunst by:</p>
          <p><code>git clone https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst.git</code><br>
            <code>cd dunst</code><br>
            <code>make</code><br>
            <code>sudo make install</code></p>
          <p>And that should be the end of that. I <em>highly</em> recommend
            installing all the dependencies before trying to <code>make</code>,
            or else you'll get some nasty errors.</p>
          <p>The next step is to switch the i3 notification daemon from the
            default to Dunst.<br>
            <code>cd</code> into <code>/usr/share/dbus-1/services/</code>, then
            find a file that looks similar to <code>org.freedesktop.Notifications</code>
            and <code>sudo vim</code> into it.</p>
          <p>After <code>Exec</code>, replace <code>Exec=/usr/lib/xfce4/notifyd/xfce4-notifyd</code>
            with:<br>
            <code>Exec=/usr/bin/dunst</code>.</p>
          <p>Save and quit!</p>
          <p>Once completed, <code>sudo mv /path/to/dunst/folder /usr/share/</code></p>
          <p>Then copy over the config file:<br>
            <code>sudo cp /usr/share/dunst/dunstrc
              /home/username/.config/dunst/dunstrc</code>.</p>
          <p>Now you can configure everything to your heart's content! <a href="https://linuxconfig.org/get-better-notifications-in-your-wm-with-dunst"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here's</a> a good article to get
            you in on the basics, and here's my dunst config file:</p>

          <p>Happy configging!</p>
