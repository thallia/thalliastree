          <span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;"></span><span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;"></span>
          <p style="width: 747px;">Now that I got the Raspberry Pi 3, I could
            rework the tech and figure out the Airplay feature to get this
            fountain working!</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">Here are the steps I used to set up my Raspi
            (SD card),&nbsp; install Lightshow Pi, and shairport-sync (airplay
            feature) on top of it:</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">I'd never reformatted an SD card before, so
            this was quite the experience.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">The first step was to find a guide, and <a href="http://qdosmsq.dunbar-it.co.uk/blog/2013/06/noobs-for-raspberry-pi/"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> website was very helpful.</p>
          <p style="width: 745px;">I slipped the microSD card into my <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13004"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">microSD card reader</a> and plugged
            it into my computer, which recognized the device. (yay!)</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">I had to find what my computer named the usb
            microSD though, so in root permissions, I ran <code>fdisk -l</code>,
            which gave me this:</p>
          <img src="../images/fdisk-pi.png" alt="" title="fdisk 1" style="width: 748px;"><br>
          <p>I knew my microSD was 16GB, so the second to last option, <code>/dev/sdb</code>,
            was the right one.<br>
            Next I needed to actually access it, so I did that with <code>fdisk
              /dev/sdb</code>. That command has to be run with root permission,
            or <code>sudo</code>.</p>
          <p>You need to delete any existing partitions on the device if there
            were any before doing anything else. You can do that using <code>d</code>,
            which will automatically delete the default partition.</p>
          <p>To list all the partitions you have, you can use <code>p</code>,
            which is useful to check what you've deleted.</p>
          <p>After deleting the partitions, <code>n</code> will create the new
            partition we need! You can give it a number (1-4) based on your
            preference (if you have a favorite number or something).<br>
            <img src="../images/fdisk1.png" alt="" title="fdisk 2"></p>
          <p>Using <code>p</code> after creating the partition shows me the new
            partition at the very bottom. But uh oh, I need a FAT32 type,
            instead of a Linux type of partition.</p>
          <p>To change that, you use the <code>t</code> command. If you request
            so, you can list all the different types of partitions there are to
            choose.<br>
            <img src="../images/fdisk2.png" alt="" title="fdisk 3"></p>
          <p>The tutorial I used recommended W95 FAT32 (all on its own, no LBA),
            so I executed <code>b</code>, which reformatted it. Yay!</p>
          <p>At the end of all that, you use <code>w</code> to write all the
            progress and finish the dealio.<br>
            The first time I did all that, I got an error in the terminal about
            “invalid argument, kernel is using the old partition table until you
            reboot” or something, but after some fiddling with the commands it
            gave me the right thing.</p>
          <p>(EDIT [09-19-17] ~ to get rid of the error, you need to run `fdisk`
            on the home device, not the partition. So instead of running “fdisk
            /dev/sdb1”, you should run “fdisk /dev/sdb”, because sdb1 is a
            partition.)&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Next, I needed to install Raspbian, the Raspberry Pi OS. I
            downloaded the full version of Raspbian Jessie Desktop from the <a
              href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi website</a> and unzipped it.</p>
          <p>Next thing I did was run <code>df -h</code>, which helped me see
            the device name of my SD card (it was still <code>/dev/sdb</code>).</p>
          <p>Then I unmounted the SD card (so files can't be read or written in
            the process of downloading an image) with <code>umount /dev/sdb</code>.
            If you still have multiple partitions, you should unmount all of
            them.</p>
          <p>Next, use the terminal to copy the image to the SD card!</p>
          <p><code>dd bs=1M
              if=/home/thallia/Desktop/2017-05-17-raspbian-jessie.img
              of=/dev/sdb</code></p>
          <p>This command must be prefixed by <code>sudo</code> if you are not
            logged in as root. <code>dd</code> starts the copying, <code>bs=1M</code>
            tells the copyer what rate the memory should be transferred at.</p>
          <p>The <code>if=</code> statement is where you put the path for where
            the image can be found. For me, it was on my desktop. The <code>of=</code>
            statement is the path of your SD card. It takes a few minutes for
            the process to complete, so getting up and stretching for a few
            minutes is a good thing to do while you wait for it to finish.</p>
          <p>After that, your SD card should be ready to plug into your
            Raspberry Pi to boot!</p>
          <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
          <p><b><a href="http://lightshowpi.org/download-and-install/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">Installing LightshowPi</a></b></p>
          <p>Because I covered most of this in another post, I'll keep it short
            so we can get to shairport-sync.</p>
          <p>Boot into your Raspberry Pi, open a terminal, and run <code>sudo
              apt-get update</code> and <code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code>.
            These shouldn't take too long.</p>
          <p>After that, if you don't have git, install it with <code>sudo
              apt-get install git-core</code>.</p>
          <p>Next, clone the LightshowPi repository to your home directory.<br>
            <code>git clone
              https://togiles@bitbucket.org/togiles/lightshowpi.git</code></p>
          <p>If you have a Raspberry Pi 3 (like me) or a Pi Zero, there's a
            different repository you have to clone because of some kernel
            issues. Here's the instruction:<br>
            <code>git clone
              https://broken2048@bitbucket.org/broken2048/lightshowpi-fork1.git</code></p>
          <p>If you don't have a Pi 3 or Zero, then don't worry about that.</p>
          <p>You'll want to make sure that you have the right branch, otherwise
            the program won't work as well. You can do that with <code>cd
              lightshowpi</code>, then <code>git fetch &amp;&amp; git checkout
              stable</code>.</p>
          <p>You should get a confirming message that you've been moved to the
            "stable" branch.</p>
          <p>Finally, you can install the software! <code>sudo ./install.sh</code>
            will set you up with the goods. This process may take anywhere from
            10 minutes to 3hrs, so be patient. After that, reboot your Pi with <code>sudo
              reboot</code>.</p>
          <p>On the LightshowPi website, you can find links for <a href="http://lightshowpi.org/configuring-and-testing-your-hardware/"

          <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
          <p>Alrighty, now to the exciting stuff! I discovered shairport-sync
            through the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/101789596301454731630"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">LightshowPi Google+ Community</a>,
            which is a very helpful place if you run into trouble setting up any
            of this stuff.</p>
          <p><a href="https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">Here</a> you can find the GitHub repository for
            shairport-sync and follow the instructions to set it up. I'll walk
            you through what I did to set mine up.</p>
          <p>First, you have to make sure you install all of the files and
            packages needed for it to work. This includes (for my setup):</p>
          <p><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential git xmltoman</code><br>
            <code>sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool libdaemon-dev
              libpopt-dev libconfig-dev</code><br>
            <code>sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev</code><br>
            <code>sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon libavahi-client-dev</code><br>
            <code>sudo apt-get install libssl-dev</code></p>
          <p>Next, you need to clone the repository to your Pi, using:<br>
            <code>git clone https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync.git</code></p>
          <p>Now, <code>cd</code> into <code>shairport-sync</code> and run <code>autoconf
              -i -f</code>. This step may take a little time.</p>
          <p>This next part was a little tricky for me to understand what was
            going on. We're writing the configuration file with the stuff we
            want so shairport will work the right way. Because I'm only using
            shairport-sync for a simple technology, I didn't have to use many
            configurations.</p>
          <p><code>./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --with-alsa --with-avahi
              --with-ssl=openssl --with-systemd --with-stdout</code></p>
          <p><code>./configure</code> is the filename, I believe, while <code>--sysconfdir=/etc</code>
            is where the file will be within the shairport directory.<br>
            <code>--with-alsa</code> [includes the ALSA backend module to audio
            to be output through the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)
            system directly. This is recommended for highest quality.] (taken
            from the github description)<br>
            <code>--with-avahi</code> [Avahi is a widely-used system-wide
            zero-configuration networking (zeroconf) service — it may already be
            in your system.]<br>
            <code>--with-ssl=openssl</code> [for encryption and related
            utilities using either OpenSSL, mbed TLS or PolarSSL.]<br>
            <code>--with-systemd</code> this command has to do with the
            particular system you have. You can use <code>man init</code> to
            find out whether you need to use <code>systemd</code> or <code>systemv</code>.<br>
            <code>--with-stdout</code> [include an optional backend module to
            enable raw audio to be output through standard output (stdout).]</p>
          <p>After executing that command, you can run <code>make</code>. When
            make is finished, install shairport-sync with <code>sudo make
              install</code>. This can take a little time as well, so get up and
            stretch!</p>
          <p>Now comes some more fun. We're going to edit some more
            configuration files, first from the shairport-sync repository. Make
            sure you <code>cd</code> into shairport-sync so you can access
            them.</p>
          <p>First, we're going to run <code>sudo nano /etc/shairport-sync.conf</code>.
            There will be a <em>lot</em> of text. <em>Do not freak out like I
              did and immediately close the document. </em></p>
          <p>As long as you can find the <code>general</code> function at the
            top and the <code>alsa</code> function in the middle of the file,
            you should be fine. In the general function, you'll see a list of
            commented out functions. You can give your Airplay feature a
            password if you don't want anyone out of the blue using it, but I
            didn't set that up.</p>
          <p>At the top of the file, there's a line that looks like: <code>#
              name "%H"</code><br>
            You'll want to erase the hash, and fill in the quotation marks what
            name you want to appear on the Airplay menu. I named mine "Laminar
            Pi", for the fountain purposes.</p>
          <p>Now go down to the <code>alsa</code> function, and find the line
            in the file that reads <code># output device: "hw:"</code></p>
          <p>In this line, you can choose whether you want the output sound to
            be HDMI, or headphones. I made mine headphones, because I have a
            3.5mm jack connected from the Pi to a portable bluetooth speaker. It
            makes for easy sound testing. Remember to delete the hash so it's
            used in the setup.<br>
            That's all I modified in the shairport-sync config file, but if you
            find yourself in a more complicated situation, the github
            instructions have plenty of information and examples for you to
            figure it out.</p>
          <p>To save the config file, <code>Ctrl-x</code> will do the job, <code>y</code>
            to agree to save the file, and enter to seal the deal.</p>
          <p>Working with the pi, there's a special thing you can add to the
            Raspberry Pi boot file to make the sound clearer. To get to that,
            enter <code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt</code>.</p>
          <p>At the very bottom of that file, add the line: <code>audio_pwn_mode=2</code></p>
          <p><code>Ctrl-x</code> will save and get you outta there, and that
            section of shairport-sync is finished! Only a few more steps left to
            go.</p>
          <p>Now, <code>cd</code> into your <code>lightshowpi</code>
            directory, then into the <code>config</code> directory. The path
            looks like this: <code>cd lightshowpi/config</code><br>
            Next, run <code>sudo nano defaults.cfg</code></p>
          <p>This is the configuration file for LightshowPi, where we can alter
            how things will outpstrut and work together.<br>
            If you scroll down past the information about the GPIO pins, shortly
            after you'll come to a section about playlist modes. You can skip a
            little farther down to the <code>stream-in</code> section.</p>
          <p>There's a line that looks like this: <code># mode = stream-in</code><br>
            You'll want to uncomment that (delete the hash). Go down a few lines
            to:<br>
            <code>stream_command_string = sudo mpg123 --stdout
              http://193.34.51.115:80</code> And put a hash in front of it to
            comment it out. Then go down a few more lines to:<br>
            <code># stream_command_string = shairport-sync -v -o stdout</code><br>
            And uncomment (delete the hash) to activate shairport-sync.</p>
          <p>Use <code>Ctrl-x</code> to save the file and exit nano, and you
            should be ready to start up the hardware!<br>
            Assuming you've <a href="http://lightshowpi.org/configuring-and-testing-your-hardware/"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up and tested your hardware</a>,
            <code>cd ..</code> out of the <code>config</code> directory, but
            stay in the LightshowPi directory.</p>
          <p>To start the software and give off the Airplay signal, run:<br>
            <code>sudo python py/synchronized_lights.py</code></p>
          <p>Hook your phone up to the Pi Airplay signal, and your lights should
            start up to whatever sound you play through your phone!<br>
            Please contact me if you have any questions.</p>
