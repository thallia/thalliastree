          <p style="width: 746px;">The second to last step of getting the tech
            for my laminar fountain is complete!</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">I ordered a pack of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C19ENDM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 RGB LEDs</a>, super bright (not
            to mention cheap), from Amazon, and they came yesterday. Very good
            quality materials. I tore apart my old wiring setup and got these
            new LEDs ready for action.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">I stuck four of 'em into a breadboard and
            then calculated the resistance for each color using the voltage drop
            information from the sticker on the bag. The red LED had a drop of
            2.0-2.2V, and the green/blue LEDs had a drop of 3.0-3.2V.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">With this info, you can calculate the
            strength of resistor that you need. You take the input voltage of
            your device (in my case, 5V) and subtract the voltage drop from the
            initial voltage. 5V - 2.2V = 2.8V. Now I take the kind of current
            that runs through them, 20mA, and divide 2.8V by 20mA (or 0.02A),
            which results in 140 Ohms. I didn't have a 140 Ohm Resistor, but I
            did have a 150 Ohm, so I used that from my <a href="//www.amazon.com/dp/B016NXK6QK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_a-xFzbEF7HZ4V">handy
              resistor pack</a> I got from amazon for $8.</p>
          <p style="width: 749px;">Doing the same calculations with the
            Green/Blue LEDs, I got 90 Ohms, which I used 100 Ohm resistors for.</p>
          <p style="width: 749px;">With all the resistors hooked up and the
            jumper wires attached, this is what my setup looked like:</p>
          <img src="../images/rgb-leds-are-in.jpg" alt="" title="RGB leds are in"
            style="width: 746px;"></div>
        <div>
          <p>It's basically a jungle of wires.</p>
          <p>Here's the GPIO pins I hooked each one up to:</p>
          <p>(RGB 1 - upper right) red=pin0, green=pin2, blue=pin 4<br>
            (RGB 2 - lower left) red=pin1, green=pin3, blue=pin<br>
            (RGB 3 - lower right) red=pin6, green=pin0, blue=pin<br>
            (RGB 4 - lower left) red=pin7, green=pin1, blue=pin3</p>
          <p>The result was strikingly happy! Check it out:</p>

          <p style="width: 746px;">I did have a bit of trouble with the sound
            portion of it all, somehow I configured the music to be
            ear-blastingly loud, and my little tiny iHome speaker didn't have
            any volume control. So after blowing up my ears multiple times
            trying to figure out what went weird, all I did was enter <code>alsamixer</code>
            into my terminal, and there were sound controls right there for me.
            Woohoo! Just a few up/down keystrokes and the sound was ready to go.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">For the fountain, it's also very inconvenient
            that if I want any of this to work, I have to download the music I
            want to hear onto the raspi via flash drive. My friend and I decided
            that was dumb, so I researched how to get music by either bluetooth
            or some sort of airplay function. I discovered a fantastic program
            called <a href="https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">shairport-sync</a>, which works like any airplay
            device. It'll broadcast an airplay-like signal to your apple devices
            that allows your phone, ipad, or computer to access and live-stream
            media through.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Sadly, though, my raspberry pi is a bit too
            old to support the software. I was able to get it installed
            perfectly and my phone all connected, but when I attempted to play a
            song, the lights lit up once and nothing came out of the speaker.
            After figuring out that my hardware was the problem, my friend
            offered to pay for a new Raspberry Pi 3 that'll support the function
            much better. That's coming soon, so I get to reinstall and figure
            this all out on a new Raspi! Until then, I've made good progress.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">After we figure out the new raspi, I'll order
            some insulated wire and get that hooked up to each LED that'll sit
            inside the fountain to make pretty colored water.</p>
          <p>Bye for now!</p>
