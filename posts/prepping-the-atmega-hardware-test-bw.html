          <p>Now that the basis code is all ready, it was time to test it out
            without help of the Arduino UNO, straight with the hardware of the
            ATmega328P.</p>
          <p>After doing research, if you have a completely empty ATMega328P,
            you need to burn the bootloader, load the new code, and burn the
            fuse bytes to be clocked by an external clock (not to mention find a
            way <em>how</em> to burn the fuse bytes).</p>
          <p>I didn't know how to do any of this at first, but with careful
            research and reading of a lot of stackexchange forum posts and blog
            posts, I was able to complete these seemingly tough tasks.</p>
          <p>Burning the bootloader is important if you want to program the
            ATMega328P through the ArduinoIDE, it allows the arduinoIDE to
            communicate to the microcontroller and write the code accurately to
            the memory.</p>
          <p>There are multiple ways to go about burning the bootloader, but
            many of the suggested ways on the Arduino website failed to succeed
            with my ATMegas, so I resorted to a much easier setup, with <code>optiLoader</code>.</p>
          <p>Following <a href="http://3g1l.com/blog-burn-bootloader-blank-atmega328atmega328p-arduino-uno"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> documentation, I got the
            bootloader setup correctly.</p>
          <p>You need an Arduino UNO, a 16MHz crystal, 2 22pF capacitors, and a
            10K resistor. Some say you can do it with or without the 16MHz
            crystal and the capacitors, but mine wouldn't work without them, so
            it's a good idea to have some on hand in case you get the same
            errors I did.</p>
          <p>First, create a directory in your Arduino folder, where all the
            sketches are usually kept. Name the directory <code>optiLoader</code>,
            and in that directory, use git to clone the repo into that folder:</p>
          <p><code>git clone https://github.com/WestfW/OptiLoader.git</code></p>
          <p>after it clones, upload the <code>.ino</code> file to the UNO,
            then setup your breadboard.</p>
          <p>The breadboard setup looks like this, adding the capacitors and
            16MHz crystal needed:</p>

        <div style="width: 747px;"><br>
        </div>
        <div style="width: 747px;">
          <p>Once done, double check your wires, I goofed up on one and it threw
            my circuit off. Double checking<em> always</em> pays off!</p>
          <p>Plug the Arduino UNO into a power source, open the serial monitor
            at baud (19200), and you should see the output of success or
            failure!</p>
          <img src="../images/prep-atmega-2.png" alt=""></div>
        <div style="width: 747px;">
          <p>Congrats, you just burned your bootloader.</p>
          <p>Next step, burning the fuse bytes....but uh, what are those? How
            does that all work?</p>
          <p>There are usually two or three fuse bytes in a microcontroller, and
            these fuse bytes are programmed to tell the microcontroller how to
            work, for example: which clock to use (external, internal, how
            fast/slow), how much memory to set aside for programs, the boot
            sequence, watchdog timer setup, etc.</p>
          <p>They're factory set when you buy them, so if you end up messing
            around with the circuit and find you need an external crystal like I
            did, you're gonna need to reprogram the fuse bytes.<br>
            A counterintuitive part of this process is: <strong>a bit set to 0
              means it is <em>programmed</em>, and a bit set to 1 is <em>unprogrammed.</em></strong></p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WARNING:</strong></span>
            if you do not do this correctly, you may end up with a
            microcontroller that does not work!</p>
          <p>Still with me? Didn't get scared? Great. Let's move on!</p>
          <p>I recommend pulling up the ATmega328P datasheet to follow along in
            this topic, you'll need to scan through it as I go over things.</p>
          <p>There are two fuse bytes we'll be working with. The High fuse byte
            and the Low fuse byte. There are 8 bits within each, and they all
            stand for a different setting.</p>
          <img src="../images/prep-atmega-3.jpg" alt="">
          <p>This is the HIGH fuse byte, 0b11011001. As you can see, certain 1s
            are unprogrammed and the 0s are programmed.</p>
          <p>The fuse byte that we'll be toying with is the LOW fuse byte:</p>
          <img src="../images/prep-atmega-4.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div style="width: 747px;">
          <p>In a <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/atmega328p-fuse-bits-and-an-external-crystal-oscillator/"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">very helpful article</a>, they
            mentioned that you do <em>not</em> want CKDIV to be programmed if
            you're adding a crystal, so I automatically know that's 1. We're
            going to leave CKOUT, and move on to finding SUT1, SUT0, and
            CKSEL3..0.</p>
          <img src="../images/prep-atmega-5.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div style="width: 747px;">
          <p>In the chart above, we see that there are multiple different clocks
            you can program the ATmega328P to choose from. In our case, we want
            the Low Power Crystal Oscillator, which, on the side, means that
            based on how we configure it, the nybble of CKSEL could be anywhere
            from 1111 to 1000. That gives us a good approximation, and helps us
            move onto the next chart:</p>
          <img src="../images/prep-atmega-6.png" alt="">
          <p>Here, this chart tells us what CKSEL will be based on the MHz value
            of our crystal. I'm using a 16MHz, so CKSEL[3:1] is going to be <code>111</code>.
            That also means I'll use two 22pF capacitors.</p>
          <p>Alright, so we have the first part of our LOW byte, now we need to
            figure out what CKSEL0 and SUT[1:0] are.</p>
          <img src="../images/prep-atmega-7.png" alt=""></div>
        <div style="width: 747px;">
          <p>Woot woot! Final chart!<br>
            Go down and find Crystal Oscillator, which is what we're using, and
            we're going to "select" <code>slowly rising power</code>. This will
            help save battery life in the long run, even if it loses a bit of
            accuracy. (it'll be accurate enough.)</p>
          <p>Therefore, our whole byte looks like this:</p>
          <p><strong>CKDIV8</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
            <strong>CKOUT &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; 1<br>
            <strong>SUT1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            1<br>
            <strong>SUT0</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            1<br>
            <strong>CKSEL3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
            <strong>CKSEL2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
            <strong>CKSEL1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
            <strong>CKSEL0</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</p>
          <p>0b11111111, or 0xFF in hexadecimal. Now, we can officially set up
            our hardware to burn these fuse bytes to the GND!</p>
          <p>...ha. See what I did there?</p>
          <p>Your circuit setup, if using the Arduino UNO as the ISP programmer,
            should look something like this:</p>
          <img src="../images/prep-atmega-8.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div style="width: 747px;">
          <p><code>UNO pin 11 (MOSI) -- atmega pin 18</code><br>
            <code>UNO pin 12 (MISO) -- atmega pin 17</code><br>
            <code>UNO pin 13 (SCK) -- atmega pin 19</code><br>
            <code>UNO pin 10 (SS) -- atmega pin 1</code></p>
          <p>Connect all Vcc's and GNDs.<br>
            Put the external 16MHz crystal and connect it to the crystal pins on
            the ATmega, physical pins 9 and 10, then add the capacitors and
            ground them, basically the same setup as when you burned the
            bootloader.</p>
          <p>.......And then, I derped.</p>
          <p>Turns out when you burn the bootloader it already set the low fuse
            byte to 0xFF, so I didn't have to burn the fuse bytes at all!<br>
            Ah, oh well, it was a good learning experience to understand
            datasheets more. :)</p>
          <p>SO! I loaded my binary watch program, placed it back in the
            circuit...and it <em>still</em> didn't work. Gah. Super
            frustrating.</p>
          <p>I decided to go back to basics and look up what's actually needed
            for an ATMega328P to work individually on a breadboard, and this
            Quora post saved my patookie:
https://www.quora.com/Can-I-use-ATmega328P-without-Arduino-just-using-it-in-breadboard-for-projects</p><img
            src="../images/prep-atmega-9.png" alt=""></div>
        <div style="width: 747px;">
          <p>This picture shows the basics of what you need for your ATmega:</p>
          <p>10Kohm Resistor to RESET pin<br>
            AGND to GND<br>
            AREF and AVCC to Vcc<br>
            the Clock on pins XTAL1 and XTAL2(PB6 and PB7) with capacitors tied
            to GND</p>
          <p>And of course the regular Vcc and GNDs. I realized my derpiness and
            found that I hadn't connected a 10K resistor to RESET, nor had I
            connected AREF and AVCC to Vcc. I fixed both of those, restarted the
            microcontroller, and viola! My code was working!!</p>
          <p>Recap:</p>
          <p>Make sure you have not just the right pins, but ALL the pins needed
            to make sure your microcontroller works.</p>
          <p>Here's the CORRECT pinout for all the pins in my code and external
            ones I wanted to remember:
