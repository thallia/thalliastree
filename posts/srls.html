          <p style="width: 744px;">lá maith, good day!</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">Spaced Repetition Learning Systems...what are
            <em>those</em>? SRS for short, Spaced Repetition Systems are tools
            to help you memorize anything you wish to have embedded in your
            brain for a good long while. Be it the nouns and verbs of a new
            language, definitions of terms from a class you are taking,
            mathematical equations, or the periodic table of elements, this is a
            great way to get started memorizing all those details.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">When taking a new class and learning all of
            this new material, you take notes and mentally exclaim, "I am
            totally going to remember all this!"<br>
            Yet, three days later, you've forgotten most of that new knowledge
            (if you haven't made an effort to retain it). While people say
            there's a big learning curve to new subjects, there's also a large <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">forgetting curve</a> that happens 24-36 hours after
            you have been presented with new information.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">Spaced Repetition Systems take the efficiency
            of memorizing via flashcards and spread the memorization out
            effectively over shortened periods of time, allowing the information
            to seep into your brain at a non-overwhelming speed and increase the
            rate of retention.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system">Leitner
              System</a>, a simple implementation of the SRS concept. I wanted
            to get down and dirty with the project, so I built my own system out
            of cardboard and decked it out with <a href="http://www.sheknows.com/home-and-gardening/articles/951617/what-is-washi-tape">washi
              tape </a>when I finished, to make it look happy.</p>
          <img src="../images/srls-leitner.jpg" alt="leitner system" title="leitner system"
            style="width: 746px;">
          <p>Not too shabby, eh?</p>
          <p>It's pretty shabby.</p>
          <p>In case you don't like the idea of making your own Leitner system,
            there is an online version by the name of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>
            that works just as well.</p>
          <p>As you can see, I marked each compartment with a "c1, c2, c3,
            ...cN", giving me seven mini-boxes. In a Spaced Repetition System,
            you start out with all your flash cards in the first compartment.
            Those cards you review <em>every day</em>. When you get a
            definition or concept right, you're allowed to move that flashcard
            to the next compartment, where you review those card every <em>three
              days</em>. If and when you get them right again, you move those
            cards to the next section, where you review them every <em>five
              days</em>. If you get a concept or definition wrong, though, you
            have to move the card back to the previous compartment.<br>
            When you finally get to the end of the compartments and have
            reviewed those cards at least 5 times, they can be put into the
            retired deck to be reviewed once a month.</p>
          <p>Here's a visual:</p>
          <img src="../images/vocabulary-leitner-system.jpg" alt="wiki-leitner"
            title="wiki-leitner"></div>
        <div style="width: 747px;">&nbsp;</div>
        <div style="width: 747px;">I initially used the Leitner System for
          simple definitions and words with a one sentence answer. As I began to
          realize its efficiency, I added more complicated subjects onto my
          flashcards: concepts that required me to explain them out loud like I
          was teaching this new idea to a five year old. This extended my
          ability not only to remember the concepts, but pushed me to create new
          ways to explain and understand what information I was conveying.
          <p>I have successfully memorized over 400 definitions, concepts, and
            programming instructions with the Leitner System. It only takes me,
            at most, five to ten minutes a day to complete. This is extremely
            useful when you're venturing into a new and daunting field that
            requires you to remember hundreds of definitions on the spot, such
            as biology or engineering. The Leitner System and SRSs are an
            incredible tool to help learn a new language, memorize some babe's
            phone number, self-teach programming concepts or terms, remember
            dates for history finals, teach yourself guitar chords, there are no
            limits. <em>Anything</em> can be put into this, and, if you put in
            enough effort, you'll have a bunch of neat things embedded in your
            mind for any situation you find yourself in.</p>
          <p>Happy learning!<br>
