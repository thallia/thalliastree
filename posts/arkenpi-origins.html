          <p>Before assembling anything, I had to get the Pi3 to boot with the
            Adafruit PiTFT plus, which was a pain in the butt. The adafruit
            website declared,</p>
          <p>"The display uses the hardware SPI pins (SCK, MOSI, MISO, CE0, CE1)
            as well as GPIO #25 and #24. GPIO #18 can be used to PWM dim the
            backlight if you like. All other GPIO are unused."</p>
          <p>I found that to be false info. I scratched my head trying to figure
            out how to find which pins were being used and which ones weren't,
            and I came up with the brilliant and monotonous idea of connecting
            40 jumper wires from the PiTFT to the Pi 3. I disconnected each pin
            one at a time to see if it would boot correctly, then removed the
            jumper wire if it wasn't needed. In thirty minutes, I had the right
            pins to get the Pi to boot onto the TFT.</p>

          <p>Using the chart above helped a lot (credit to whoever's chart it
            is), and here are the GPIO pin numbers I came up with, and their
            functions:</p>
          <p><code> pin 1 - 3.3V PWR</code></p>
          <p><code>pin 2 - 5V PWR</code></p>
          <p><code>pin 9 - GND</code></p>
          <p><code>pin 18 - GPIO24 (GPIO_GEN5)</code></p>
          <p><code>pin 19 - GPIO10 (SPI0_MOSI)</code></p>
          <p><code>pin 21 - GPIO9 (SPI0_MISO)</code></p>
          <p><code>pin 22 - GPIO25 (GPIO_GEN6)</code></p>
          <p><code>pin 23 - GPIO11 (SPI0-_CLK)</code></p>
          <p><code>pin 24 - GPIO8 (SPI_CE0_N)</code></p>
          <p><code>pin 26 - GPIO7 (SPI_CE1_N)</code></p>
          <p><code>pin 27 - ID_SD (I2C EEPROM)</code></p>

          <p>I had to wait three to four days for the case to finish drying, but
            boy, was it worth it!</p>
          <p>I started by desoldering the Li-Po battery from the inside of the
            bluetooth keyboard, attaching to the leads the 5.5V to 3.3V step
            down converter.<br>
            <img src="../images/arkenpi-step-down.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p>The <em>Vout</em> of the step down I soldered go to the 5V and GND
            through-holes on the Adafruit Powerboost 1000c.</p>
          <p>I left the original USB port on the adafruit powerboost and
            permanently soldered it to the board.</p>
          <img src="../images/arkenpi-powerboost.jpg" alt="">
          <p>I figured it would be easier to use a well off microUSB cord than
            to play around with making my own with hookup wire. Fortunately, I
            had an older (and shorter) microUSB cord that was just for power,
            not data transfer, so I used that. I wasn't able to fit the microUSB
            cord through the holes in the case, so I stripped off the plastic
            cover to reveal the wires, and I soldered those onto the Pi. I
            checked with a multimeter which pads were 5V and GND, so I knew
            where to solder.</p>
          <p><img src="../images/arkenpi-powercord.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p><img src="../images/arkenpi-powerpi.jpg" alt=""><br>
          </p>
          <p>In the end, I decided to forget attempting to get 12 hookup wires
            through the holes in the case, and I resoldered a 2x20 GPIO header
            onto the Pi and connected the PiTFT on top of those (like it was
            intended to be used).</p>
          <p>In the case, I drilled two holes for a power light and a low
            battery light. All of these I soldered from the adafruit powerboost,
            so I rigged up my 3mm LEDs.<br>
            <img src="../images/arkenpi-led.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p>I wrapped a 200ohm resistor around the stripped wire, soldered the
            two joints, then trimmed the wires.</p>
          <p>I accidentally burned out an LED before realizing that the resistor
            was in parallel, therefore not allowing the full resistance to get
            to the LED. I trimmed the wire after that. (below)</p>
          <img src="../images/arkenpi-led-2.jpg" alt=""><br>
          My solder joints are pretty ugly, I know. But I promise I made them
          nicer! I also covered that part of the wire in electrical tape.</div>
        <div style="width: 747px;"><img src="../images/arkenpi-led-3.jpg" alt=""><br>
          <p>Next was to solder hookup wire to the male USBs:</p>
          <p><img src="../images/arkenpi-usb.jpg" alt=""><br>
            I made each one a different length, since the female USBs were
            different lengths away.</p>
          <p><img src="../images/arkenpi-usb-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p>Hot gluing the solder joints was a life saver for me, because if
            you bent the connections/wires too much the joints would break off.</p>
          <img src="../images/arkenpi-usb-2.jpg" alt="">
          <p>After putting each USB in, I had to bend and twist the wires so the
            Raspberry Pi and PiTFT still fit snugly in the case, with the wires
            bent around it.</p>
          <p><img src="../images/arkenpi-usb-3.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p>I soldered the 3 green wires to the Vs, EN, and GND through-holes
            and connected them to the power switch (not shown). The USB cable
            soldered to the pi I plugged into the socket, and in the top right
            hand corner I used a multimeter to find the polarities of the Low
            Battery LED pads, and soldered one of the 3mm LEDs to that.</p>
          <p>Under that swarm of wires I placed the LiPo battery and taped it to
            the bottom with electrical tape.</p>
          <p>Soon after, all I had to do was plug in the LiPo to the Powerboost
            1000c, put the bevels in place, and watch the magic happen (the tape
            is on the top because I haven't decided on a good way to secure the
            bevel yet).</p>

          <p>Viola!! My very own portable linux computer. SO EXCITED!!</p>
          <p>And yes, that <em>is</em> Doctor Strange as my background. ;)</p>
          <p>I'm feeling very accomplished about this, and I hope this
            walk-through has entertained you or inspired you to make one of your
            own.<br>
            If you have any questions about things I did, don't hesitate to
