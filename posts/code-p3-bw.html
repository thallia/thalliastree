              Code - Part 3 | Binary Watch<br>
            </span></h2>
          <span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;"></span><br>
          <p>Last we talked about the Binary watch I was busy finishing up the
            second rendition of the working code and getting ready to complete
            the schematic.</p>
          <p>As the date I head off to college comes nearer and nearer, the
            urgency of finishing my projects is heightening! And so I take to
            Spacemacs to venture through the depths of ATmega328P's sleep modes,
            RTC modes, and more...</p>
          <p>I roughly sketched out a nice schematic on EagleCAD that will soon
            be posted in my GitHub, but I gotta finish some hardware testing
            before that happens.</p>
          <p>As for the code side of things, the next steps were to research
            sleep modules and see which ones work with my project set-up the
            best.</p>
          <p>Reading through the datasheet is rather monotonous, it gave me a
            vague idea of what the sleep modules were, but I still had a hazy
            view of what I needed to do, so I headed over to the <a href="https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/50733/is-there-a-way-to-disable-modules-like-adc-without-a-sleep-mode">Arduino
              Stack Exchange</a>.</p>
          <p>My initial (albeit naive) idea was to keep the CPU, flash, and
            Clock running while putting all other modules to sleep. I started to
            test this, but disabling the modules had hardly no effect on the
            current pull of the ATmega328p, which was another reason I asked on
            Stack Exchange. One person said,</p>
          <p>"<span class="comment-copy">You do <b>not</b> want to keep the CPU
              running on a battery-powered project! You should use a timer for
              keeping the time, and let the CPU sleep. Ideally, you would
              connect a 32,768 Hz crystal to TOSC1/TOSC2 and have Timer 2 work
              in RTC mode. I have <a href="https://www.logre.eu/wiki/Horloge_analogique_24h/en"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer">a clock</a> running since June 2012 on
              the same pair of AA cells using this low-power technique.</span>"</p>
          <p>This piqued my interest, so I went to research heavily on what RTC
            mode was, and how this stuff works alongside a sleep mode.</p>
          <p>RTC stands for Real Time Clock, which is typically a 32.768kHz
            crystal externally connected to TOSC1/TOSC2 or XTAL1/XTAL2 pins.
            This RTC mode allows the entire microcontroller to sleep, while
            still ticking the external clock outside the sleep mode. With
            SLEEP_MODE_PWR_SAVE, the second-to-lowest power saving mode, you can
            wake it up through either a timer interrupt or a signal on the
            INT0/INT1 pin.</p>
          <p>This seemed like the best solution, but how to implement it?<br>
            I have found *tons* of different code and libraries for this, so
            much so that I just got confused.</p>
          <p>After much research and questioning, I came to two conclusions, of
            which I will try both:</p>
          <p>1) Write code to work with an RTC/IC, like the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/ds1307-real-time-clock-breakout-board-kit/what-is-an-rtc"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">DS1307</a> and code from <a href="https://github.com/MajicDesigns/MD_DS1307"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">this arduino library</a>, that way
            I don't have to mess around with setting all the hardware bits and
            bytes and confusing myself to no end. (more documentation on the
            arduino library <a href="https://majicdesigns.github.io/MD_DS1307/index.html">here</a>)
            It seems as though the DS1307 is a plug'n'play device, as long as
            you get the code right.</p>
          <p>2) [as of 3-15-17 at <a href="https://youtu.be/cUFJ1yVhJ6g">23:19</a>]
            Test out <a href="https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/50733/is-there-a-way-to-disable-modules-like-adc-without-a-sleep-mode?noredirect=1#comment103133_50733"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Gammon's response</a> on my
            Stack Exchange question. The code he gave me was very insightful
            with accomplishing all the bits and bytes and changing the hardware
            registers.</p>
          <p>I have ordered some 32.768kHz crystals and the DS1307 board, both
            of which should come this Monday. In the meantime, I <a href="https://github.com/thallia/BinaryWatch/blob/master/src/bwatch3-0.cpp"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">typed up some quick code</a> to go
            with the DS1307, and <a href="https://github.com/thallia/BinaryWatch/blob/master/src/bwatch-clk.cpp"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">adjusted the code</a> from stack
            exchange. Both compile normally, so we'll have to see how it works
            out when the actual hardware arrives. I'm sure mass debugging will
            entail...</p>
          <p>Depending on which one works best for my purposes, I'll adapt the
            schematic to the design and then start work on the PCB.</p>
