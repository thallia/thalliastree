              QEMU Debugging and TIL<br>
            </span></h2>
          <span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;"></span>
          <p>This week was <em>busy.</em></p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">I helped co-teach an improv rehearsal while
            my coach was away, spontaneously went to see a movie with friends,
            finished some good books (Debugging by David Agans and How to Read A
            Book by Mortimer J. Adler), and wrote the entirety of a rough
            program in a day that converted numbers between base 2, 10, and 16,
            or as their familiar names are called, binary, decimal, and
            hexadecimal. I wrote it for the purpose of re-familiarizing myself
            with the Forth language, since I haven't written a program with
            Forth in a while. About a quarter of the way through, the program
            turned out to be a funny talk-show-like system with cheesy jokes and
            puns. You can check it out on <b><a href="https://github.com/thallia/dechexbin"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #3653b9;">GitHub</a></b>.<br>
            Forth is an awesome interactive language, you can check it out here
            with the official online book by Leo Brodie, <b><span style="color: #3653b9;"><a
                  href="https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starting
                  Forth</a></span></b>. I'll write a bigger post on Forth later,
            today I'm sharing my debugging issues and talking about a system
            emulator called QEMU.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Once I finished my Forth conversion program,
            I took a break, but eventually gravitated&nbsp; towards finishing an
            old assembly program I wrote a while back that converted an array of
            fahrenheit values to celsius. I had finished it, but unfortunately,
            lost all my work when I accidentally wiped the contents of my
            computer (which is a story for another time). I used QEMU to debug
            it at the time, but I lost my debugging log along with the wipe,
            sadly.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;"><b><a href="http://www.qemu.org/" style="color: #3653b9;">QEMU</a></b>
            is a downloadable, open source, full system emulator. You can use it
            to emulate types of processor cores/CPUs, machines, or OSs all
            without having to own the actual device. It's handy when you don't
            have the money to buy an actual microcontroller, and you can run it
            straight from your terminal.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">I finished rewriting my program in ARM
            assembly and geared up to debug my messy, night-time written code,
            until the qemu commands I had recovered suddenly failed. I was
            executing:<br>
            <code><br>
            </code></p>
          <p style="width: 748px;"><code>qemu-system-arm -machine raspi2 -cpu
              cortex-m3 -s -S -nographic -kernel -gdb tcp::1234 f-c2.elf</code></p>
          <p>First I got the error:</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;"><code>qemu-system-arm: -kernel -gdb: Unknown
              protocol 'tcp'</code><br>
            <code>WARNING: Image format was not specified for 'f-c2.elf' and
              probing guessed raw.<br>
              Automatically detecting the format is dangerous for raw images,
              write operations on block 0 will be restricted.<br>
              Specify the 'raw' format explicitly to remove the restrictions.<br>
              qemu: could not load kernel '-gdb'</code></p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">I added <code>-raw</code>, but all I got
            back with that command was a terminal prompt. I consulted my friend
            uelen (way-len) who knows more about QEMU than I do (something I
            hope to change in the future).</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">He shared that <code>-s</code> did the same
            thing as <code>-gdb tcp::1234</code> so that was all redundant. I
            ended up deleting <code>-raw</code> as well.<br>
            I reformulated my qemu execution to end up with:<br>
            <code>qemu-system-arm -machine raspi2 -cpu cortex-m3 -s -S
              -nographic -kernel f-c2.elf</code></p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">And it worked!<br>
            I ran that in a terminal, and in another, I connected the trusty GDB
            debugger to my emulated system with <code>target remote
              localhost:1234</code>.<br>
            GDB has been a bit of a stinker since then, and I haven't been able
            to debug my code because it's been sending random addresses to the
            program counter and jumping to pieces of code that don't even exist
            (I guess this code exists, though, must've come from the 4th
            dimension or something). I spent most of today working on it, but
            only got so far with hardly any leads.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">Somehow my program's first instruction, <code>mov
              r0, #16</code>, loads <code>#12</code> into the link register,
            and random addresses are put into the program counter. I made sure
            that there were no addresses in <code>r0</code> when the program
            started, so there's no way I could somehow be <em>moving</em>
            anything into the PC or LR. I made sure it failed like that multiple
            times so I can accurately state that. But as David Agans says in his
            amazing book, <b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Indispensable-Software-Hardware-Problems/dp/0814474578"
                style="color: #3653b9;">Debugging</a></b>, even "that" can
            happen, when you know it can't.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">All that to say, debugging is long and
            challenging, especially with things you're not horribly familiar
            with yet. After spending much of my day attempting to find out gdb's
            mysteries, I am retiring to my happy place, reading books and
            working with some Forth.</p>
          <p>But before I leave, TIL! (Today I Learned)</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">TIL to really apply the concepts I learned in
            Debugging by David Agans, from changing one thing at a time, to
            keeping an audit trail, to quit thinking and just looking (I think I
            used that rule the most).</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">I learned that when you get an error for the
            504th time, it's not the end of the world.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">TIL that sharing source code is really fun
            and really freaky at the same time, because on one end you're
            thinking, "oh my goodness griefcious they're totally going to judge
            my code and think I'm stupid for writing it this way instead of that
            way!" while on the other hand, you're thinking "LOOK AT THIS LITTLE
            BABY PROGRAM I MADE ISN'T IT GREAT?" When in reality no one
            intensively looks at it and only tries to help figure out your
            problem. (those who <em>do</em> judge your code are either trying
            to help you but are unintentionally coming off as stand-offish, or
            they are just deciding to be turd blossoms.)</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">I learned that sometimes, it's okay to pause
            from figuring out a problem to eat some chips and fruit while you
            ponder your existence and if it's really worth it to figure this
            problem out.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">I learned that it's good to ask for help when
            you have no idea where to start looking to find out why your system
            emulator is being finicky (<b style="color: #3653b9;"><a href="https://qemu.weilnetz.de/doc/qemu-doc.html">QEMU
                User Documentation</a></b>, I'm looking at you).</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">And finally, TIL that making sure you
            recompile your altered code before running it again is a <em>really</em>
            good idea.</p>
          <p>Until next time, folks!</p>
