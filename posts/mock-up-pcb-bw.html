              Mock Up PCB | Binary Watch<br>
            </span></h2>
          <p>I soldered deep into the night....and all throughout today.<br>
            After hours of writing and testing code, fiddling with hardware, and
            scraping through error after error, I can present to you the first
            mock up through-hole PCB!</p>
          <p>I designed the schematic on EasyEDA:</p>
          <p><img src="../images/mock-pcb-1.png" alt=""><br>
          </p>
          <p>And followed the setup from there. I'll redo the schematic on
            EagleCAD because I was using EasyEDA mainly for the learning
            experience of using a different software. I could stand to make it a
            bit easier to look at, too.</p>
          <p>Getting all my tools and supplies out, I pumped this guy out after
            a few hours:</p>
          <img src="../images/mock-pcb-2.jpg" alt=""><br>
          <img src="../images/mock-pcb-3.jpg" alt=""><br>
          <p>The connections on the back are a little gross, but I was excited
            to get it done! As you can see, I hadn't had room to stick a coin
            cell battery holder, let alone the battery itself on the back, so
            made a smaller PCB that acted as the power source.This was slightly
            tricky, as I had to figure out what was GND and what was the power,
            and where I was supposed to connect all the wires to.</p>
          <p>Top:<br>
            <img src="../images/mock-pcb-4.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p>Bottom:</p>
          <p><img src="../images/mock-pcb-5.jpg" alt=""><br>
            <img src="../images/mock-pcb-6.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p>Once everything was Vcc'ed and GNDed, I plugged the
            microcontroller, shift registers, and battery in....<br>
            <img src="../images/mock-pcb-7.jpg" alt=""><br>
            <br>
            and boom!</p>
          <p><img src="../images/mock-pcb-8.jpg" alt=""><br>
            <img src="../images/mock-pcb-9.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p>The coin cell battery powered it quite well, and I believe once I
            start using the deep sleep modules, it'll be even more efficient. I
            will have to test how much current the microcontrollers, shift
            registers, and LEDs are drawing to make sure, of course.<br>
            The wiring was a little iffy, if I shifted the wires by accident the
            program would restart. I wasn't too worried about that, because it
            worked all at once the first time I plugged it in and didn't touch
            it. A little wire debugging wouldn't hurt in the future, but I'm
            happy for now.</p>
          <p>I'm so proud of how far I've come and everything I've learned so
            far. There's nothing like a project to teach you so many new things
            and hone your skills. Here's to more advancements soon!</p>
          <p>Again, you can find the ATmega pinouts and my circuit design in
            this blog post: <a href="https://thalliatree.wordpress.com/2018/02/04/prepping-the-atmega328p-bootloader-burn-fuse-byte-programming-and-hardware-test-binary-watch/">Prepping
              the ATmega328P: bootloader burn, fuse-byte programming, and
              hardware test | binary watch</a>, as well as have access to all my
            resources on my <a href="https://github.com/thallia/BinaryWatch" target="_blank"

          <p>Next steps will require making&nbsp; a new schematic that's easier
            to read, start working with the low power modules, and sketch out
            some experimental PCB design.</p>
