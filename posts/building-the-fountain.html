          <p>And so it begins....</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">I met up with my friend this afternoon to
            start working on the fountain, boy what a project! We found things
            that we didn't want to do when making another fountain, things we
            wanted to keep, and had a good time building a thing.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">We loosely followed <b><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Laminar-Flow-Water-Jet-for-Under-25/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Instructables</a></b> to
            build the fountain. Here's our materials:</p>
          <img src="../images/laminar-materials.jpg" alt="" title="laminar materials"
            style="width: 746px;"><br>
          <p>* A 4in diameter 2ft PVC pipe<br>
            * A 4in pipe cap<br>
            * 4, 4in test plugs<br>
            * 1in diameter 1ft PVC pipe<br>
            * Window mesh<br>
            * 3/8in x 4in brass pipe<br>
            * Water sealant epoxy glue stuff<br>
            * Steel wool (or scrubbing pads)<br>
            * 400+ straws (not pictured)</p>
          <p style="width: 749px;">In all, this came out to be $32.67 at Home
            Depot. But a lot of this I bought extra (like the 2ft PVC pipe, so
            we have one pre-cut for our next fountain), and the steel
            wool....and the tons of window mesh. I'm going to have to find a
            project that incorporates a lot of that, because we have waaayyy too
            much left over. Heh.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">The first thing we did was saw the 2ft piece
            of black PVC into 1ft pieces, as the fountain body is only a foot
            long. Next, we needed to get the nozzle ready, which was the 3/8in
            brass pipe.<br>
            <img src="../images/laminar-pipe.jpg" alt="" title="laminar pipe 1"></p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">We tapered out the end of the brass nozzle
            with sand paper so the water flow would come out smooth and easy,
            and drilled a 3/8in hole in our pipe cap for the nozzle to fit.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">For some reason our 3/8in pipe was not
            actually 3/8 of an inch (not sure why), so we improvised and got the
            hole big enough for the nozzle to fit. We cut off the nozzle about
            1/2in below the ridges and sanded that down.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">Then we glued the nozzle in with superglue:<br>
            <img src="../images/laminar-pipe-1.jpg" alt="" title="laminar pipe 1"><br>
            Viola! Very pretty :)</p>
          <img src="../images/laminar-pipe-2.jpg" alt="" title="laminar pipe 2"
            style="width: 748px;"><br>
          Our next step required the 1in PVC, which is where the hose would fit
          into. I sawed it into a 3in piece, then we drilled an off-center hole
          in the big PVC to stick the smaller one into. It was an odd way to do
          something, when we really could've made the hose attachment on the
          backside of the fountain. We both decided that's what we'd do next
          time, along with purchasing a female hose connector instead of just
          using a PVC pipe.<br>
          Finally, we glued the tiny PVC into the big one with some water
          sealant epoxy glue:<br>
          <img src="../images/laminar-pipe-3.jpg" alt="" title="laminar pipe 3"><br>
          In the next step, I took the 4in test plugs and, with a super sharp
          razor blade, I cut out the insides. My arm is sore, I must say. After
          cutting out the inside, I also had to cut off the lip of the test
          plug. What was left is this white circle:<br>
          <img src="../images/laminar-pipe-4.jpg" alt="" title="laminar pipe 4"><br>
          With this, I fit some window mesh at the bottom of the fountain, right
          above the hose entrance: <br>
          <img src="../images/laminar-pipe-5.jpg" alt="" title="laminar pipe 5"><br>
          After that was done, we got to an easy part of the job. STRAWS!<br>
          <img src="../images/straws.jpg" alt="" title="straws"><br>
          We sent my friend's brother and his girlfriend on an emergency run to
          the dollar store to get us 600 bendy straws. It was lovely. We chopped
          the straws about 1/2in below the bendy part (since they were a bit too
          tall), and stuffed them into the PVC pipe on top of the window mesh. <br>
          <img src="../images/straws-1.jpg" alt="" title="straws 1"><br>
          <p>Not all of them were level, but it worked. I unfolded two chunks of
            steel wool and layered them on top of each other, then cut them in a
            circle to fit on top of the straws.</p>
          <p>We had to use the window mesh, steel wool, and straws to help
            regulate the water pressure that would be coming through the hose.
            Using those, it filters the water flow and makes it stream in
            certain shapes and mostly in one direction, which helps give you the
            smooth and transparent flow of a laminar fountain.</p>
          <p>This is what it all looked like from the top, with the steel wool
            and another sheet of window mesh:<br>
            <img src="file:///home/thallia/thalliastree/images/laminar-pipe-6.jpg"
              alt="" title="laminar pipe 6"></p>
          <p>(not horribly exciting yet, I know. Just wait!)</p>
          <p>Finally, we could start assembling it all together! We stuck the
            pipe cap on one end (with the nozzle) and on the other, we duct
            taped a test plug on the end. We didn't want to seal it all the way
            up yet in case there needed to be any changes to the initial
            structure. </p>
          <img src="../images/laminar-pipe-7.jpg" alt="" title="laminar pipe 7"><br>
          <img src="../images/laminar-pipe-8.jpg" alt="" title="laminar pipe 8"><br>
          We turned the water on and hoped for the best....Ahh! It was a <em>great</em>
          first try at the water flow. We were so excited.</div>
        <div style="width: 747px;"><img src="file:///home/thallia/thalliastree/images/laminar-pipe-9.jpg"
            alt="" title="laminar fountain"><br>
          <img src="file:///home/thallia/thalliastree/images/laminar-pipe-10.jpg"
            alt="" title="laminar fountain 10"><br>
          The water flow was a little shaky and not completely clear, and the
          pressure wasn't as strong (because we hadn't sealed the bottom of the
          fountain), but it WORKED! WOOHOO! Check it out:â€‹</div>
        <div style="width: 747px;"><video src="../images/laminar-test.mp4" preload="none"
            controls="controls"></video><br>
          <p>To troubleshoot, we took apart the fountain again and tapered the
            bottom of the nozzle inside the fountain. We think it's too long, so
            we gotta figure out a way to chop it down a few quarter inches. We
            tried some other things, but it obstructed the water flow more than
            we'd have liked, so it's back to the drawing board on that part. But
            we made great progress, and I'm proud of us both for getting this
            project done.</p>
          <p>I got the new Raspberry Pi 3 as well, so I can start working on
            reinstalling and trying all the software I've done in my previous
            posts to get the tech ready for installation. We've got wiring and
            soldering in our path...</p>
          <p>Cheers!</p>
