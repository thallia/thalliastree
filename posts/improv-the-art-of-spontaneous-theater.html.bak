              Improv: The Art of Spontaneous Theater<br>
            </span></h2>
          <span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;"></span>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Today I rode home from one of my last improv
            competitions, where I helped prepare my team to compete against
            three others in a battle of laughter and jokes. It was a three day
            competition, and each team performed 12 games. It was exhausting,
            hilarious, and wonderful bonding time with people I hadn't taken
            much time to get to know. The theme of the competition this year was
            superheroes, and my team was the <strong>JokeBusters</strong>. (I
            ain't afraid of no joke!)</p>
          <p style="width: 745px;">My team took 3rd place (though the judges
            told us we were incredibly close to reaching 2nd place), and I won
            the award for the most skilled and supportive team member. It was a
            humbling and amazing experience that I will always remember.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Acting...acting is all about taking a story
            and putting yourself in the character's shoes, immersing yourself in
            their world and becoming that person. You have a script and
            blocking, perhaps even choreography and music.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">What would happen if you had none of those
            tools, only the power of your own brain?</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">This, my friends, is improv. Improv is short
            for improvisational theater, the kind of acting with no script. You
            stand on the stage with nothing but your good looks and infinite
            intellect, and you act out a scene off the top of your head.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">I have been fortunate to partake in four
            improvisational teams as of this date through my local theater
            group, over the course of four years; I have been coached by over 7
            people who have been strong and inspirational people not only in
            theater, but in my personal life as well.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">You may be thinking, "Acting, in front of
            people, without a script. Are you <em>kidding me? </em>Aren't
            there rules to follow and structure to be had?"</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Ah, yes, my friend. Have no fear, I shall
            introduce you to the fantastic art of improvisational theater:</p>
          <p style="width: 742px;">Starting us off is the foundation of all
            stories and scenes: CROW.<br>
            Umm, isn't that a bird?<br>
            You can be fairly certain I'm laughing at you right about now.<br>
            CROW is an acronym consistently used in improv to help us
            improvisers remember what we actually need to be doing instead of
            trying to be funny.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">C stands for <em>Character</em>. In every
            scene you want to know who you are. If you don't know who you are,
            you won't have an objective that drives the scene (something your
            character wants, usually), and there won't be anything interesting
            for you to do. That would be boring. Interesting characters are at
            the heart of improv, whether it be the milkman that delivers milk to
            your house every day, your reformed pirate friend who lost both legs
            in an intense sci-fi ship battle, or your mom.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">R stands for <em>Relationship</em>. When
            you're improvising with someone, your character should have someone
            to hang out with, share some intense memories with about cheese
            festivals....perhaps they're long lost brothers, highschool
            sweethearts, best pineapple picking buddies, whoever they are, you
            need to know them. If you have a relationship, you have history with
            the person. If you have history with the person, that can influence
            the way your character interacts with them. (Of course this is all
            on the spot, so you have a literal split second to decide who you
            are and how you're related to the other person you're improvising
            with).</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">O stands for <em>Objective</em>. The
            objective is something that drives the scene, it can sprout from a
            relationship, where a drunk dude may be wanting to show off to his
            bestie that he can hit the bullseye of the target with a dart, while
            squatting, to prove that he is better than his friend (yes, that is
            a real example of a character I played. Earlier today, in fact). The
            objective is to find something that your character may naturally
            want. While trying to get what you want, it can create conflict with
            the other characters if they have opposing objectives.</p>
          <p style="width: 745px;">Finally, W stands for <em>Where</em>. In
            improv, we have no props. No sets. Anywhere we are must be
            pantomimed, as if we were actually there in real life. Whether it be
            the Himalayas, a Civil War Re-Enactment, cooking in your kitchen, or
            a port-o-potty, you must create your surroundings by interacting
            with them.</p>
          <p>Next up, I'll introduce the simplest rule in improv, the "Yes,
            And."</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">Yes, And is a term we use quite a bit. When
            your scene partner offers you something in a scene (offer means give
            you ideas to work with), you accept the offer and add onto it, such
            as:</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;"><strong>Scene Parter 1:</strong> Ah, Joe.
            I've missed you since you left for the Amazon, do tell me about your
            work wrangling the gators.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;"><strong>Scene Partner 2</strong>: Why, Bill I
            am flabbergasted you even remember me. I've been gone for
            twenty-five years! I'm surprised you even recognized my with all
            these scars. Good to see you, ol' buddy.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">If you see in that example there, SP2 <em>agreed</em>,
            and then gave SP1 more information about their relationship how long
            they've known each other, giving SP2 a chance to build even more off
            of that.<br>
            Now, lets see what would happen if we rejected the Yes, And concept.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;"><strong>SP1</strong>: Ah, Joe. I've missed
            you since you left for the Amazon, do tell me about your work
            wrangling the gators.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;"><strong>SP2: </strong>Excuse me? My name
            isn't Joe, it's <em>Steve.</em> And I wasn't in the Amazon
            wrangling alligators, I was at the pet store stroking bunny
            rabbits....for twenty-five years.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Here, SP2 completely rejected what SP1 was
            saying, and went with their own idea, which wasn't fun to watch, or
            very entertaining, for that matter. The Yes, And concept is a
            surprisingly tough one to begin using, because it makes you realize
            how much you want to say 'no' and implement your own ideas. While
            using your own ideas is good, if your partner offers you a line with
            good information in it, forget that idea about a buff twinkie dealer
            from the 1950s and agree with your parter and move on. It'll make
            the scene much smoother.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">The third concept that I learned this year
            from my improv team is called, "You and me, here and now." This
            phrase has been nailed into my head all year by my coach.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">You and me, here and now. What does that mean
            in improv terms? It means no one wants to watch a scene about two
            people talking about dogs, you want the scene focus in on the
            relationship between those two people, perhaps they are dog show
            rivals and have been fighting for the championship since they both
            came out of the womb.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">Do you see how that can be a much more
            interesting thing than watching two characters converse about
            something other than themselves?</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Next up: Don't try to be funny. Though improv
            is though of as comedy, you shouldn't try hard to get the laughs or
            the attention, improv is to make your scene partner look good and
            the laughs will come naturally. Sure, you can have a good pun or
            one-liner here and there, but it must fit in the context of the
            scene and you have to justify why you said what you did. Trying to
            be funny ends up making everyone look bad or awkward, and we don't
            really want that.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Improv is all about letting loose. One of the
            things I have learned the most in improv is to be confident in
            yourself and your choices. If someone asks you a question, such as:</p>
          <p><strong>SP1</strong>: How on earth did you find my long lost
            treasure chest of cheese?</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">You don't want to respond with a shrug and
            "Eh, I don't know." Huh? Of <em>course you know. </em>And in fact,
            it wasn't just a treasure map that led you there, but it was a
            treasure map on the back of a gum wrapper that you saved in your
            shoe from 2nd grade. You <em>do</em> know how you tripped and fell
            and broke your arm off. When you're confident in your choices, your
            scene partner gains confidence as well, and you both think clearer
            and make better scene choices.</p>
          <p>Lastly, my final bit of wisdom. Improv is <em>all about</em> <em>failing.</em></p>
          <p>Failing? Yes, failing.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Improvising a story is unexpected, random,
            and you never know what is going to come out of your mouth or your
            scene partner's mouth. If you fail, fail <em>big</em>. Make people
            <em>know</em> that you failed. Because guess what? It's funny to the
            audience or anyone who is watching, and you can learn from your
            mistakes. Sometimes your fail makes the whole scene a new and
            improved story! Failing is at the heart and soul of improv, and if
            you ever join an improv class, it's something you will find yourself
            doing often.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">It can be a hard thing to get used to,
            especially if you're someone who wants to get everything right the
            first time. But let me say this: the more you fail, the more you get
            comfortable with getting back up and trying again. Not only does
            this improve your improv (ha), but it also ends up applying to your
            real life.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Ever since I have taken part in the joys of
            improv, my life has gotten better because of it. I have learned to
            fail endlessly and get back up again, I have learned to be
            spontaneous and confident in my decisions. I have learned to lead a
            team and encourage the heck out of people, and gained an array of
            skills. It's amazing how useful thinking on your feet can be in real
            life when you're in a tight situation.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">If you ever have the chance to take an improv
            class, take part in it, only if it's for one night. Not only will it
            improve your confidence and your abilities to speak in front of
            people, it'll change the way you live and accomplish things in your
            day-to-day life.</p>
          <p>Not to mention, it's really fun to laugh.</p>
