          <p style="width: 815px;">céad míle fáilte,&nbsp; a hundred thousand
            welcomes!</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">I am thallia, a young and aspiring engineer.
            Electrical engineering and computer engineering have been my focus
            for almost a year now, alongside programming, mathematics, science,
            and a little dabble of natural medicine.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">Soon I will be shipped off to college to
            pursue my career in electrical engineering--with that I want to
            further the research and technology to aid in naturopathic and other
            natural medical care.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">The reason I chose to start a blog is due
            partially from influence of my mentor. I am a part of a team called
            <em>Under the Wire</em>, a small group of individuals with a passion
            for learning and, hopefully someday, we want to reinvent technology.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">One of the concepts provided to us by our
            mentor is called <em>infinity learning</em>. A bit dramatic, I
            know, that's what makes it fun. The concept of infinity learning is,
            ideally, where you are able to train yourself to remember the
            majority of anything you ever learn. A tool helpful to accomplish
            this is a blog.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">The blogging format gives you a place to,
            "review, clarify, and document your experiences and learnings"
            (fouric, 2017). As you learn concepts, run into problems, or
            discover new things, a skilled way of making sure you understand it
            completely and correctly is to teach it to someone else; in this
            case, write it out and explain it to others reading the blog. When
            you have a limited understanding of a concept, sharing it with
            someone else requires you to have a fuller knowledge of whatever
            you're trying to teach them, therefore pushing you to understand a
            concept to its full potential.</p>
          <p style="width: 745px;">Using a blog format also gives you a copy of
            what you know, a frame of reference for if you forget a concept or
            piece of knowledge in the future.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">With that in mind, this blog is where I'll be
            posting things that I learn, projects that I'm working on, or
            problems I run into in the process of learning. I hope some of these
            posts will teach you a thing or two, provide you with things to
            think on, or serve as entertainment in general.</p>
