              Part 2 | Binary Watch<br>
            </span></h2>
          <p><img src="../images/code-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p>Woot woot! The code is virtually finished, for the simple
            processing and buttons part at least. :)</p>
          <p>I've been utilizing the Arduino Uno this whole time since it's easy
            to program really fast, that way I could corner all the problems in
            the code so when I switch to the plain ATmega itself I'll be able to
            distinguish between what is a hardware issue and what's a software
            issue.</p>
          <p>Since last time, I've still been having issues with some of my
            functions. The <code>tick</code> problem solved some of what was
            going on, until I added the buttons into play.</p>
          <p>I connected the buttons like I configured the input pins to work;
            Pin 7 was the inHour button, Pin 8 was the inMinute button. I
            connected one side of the buttons to the input pin and the other
            side to the 3.3V power supply, enabled the functions, and reloaded
            the code.</p>
          <p>Ack.</p>
          <p>The hours and minutes started cycling too fast, and the minutes all
            of a sudden only counted to 13. What??</p>
          <p>I fiddled around with the code for a while, commenting out one
            function and seeing if it would work on its own, commenting out the
            other function, you get the idea.</p>
          <p>Eventually I caught a few syntax errors and got the functions
            working by themselves, but enabling both <code>checkHour</code> and
            <code>checkMin</code> at the same time resulted in much failure.</p>
          <p>I talked to Gector about this, and he suggested pull-up resistors.</p>
          <p>I learned that it is unwise to enable a pin as input without
            resistors like such, and here's why.<br>
            When you enable a pin as input in your code and leave it, it joins a
            state of <em>high impedance</em>, otherwise known as a floating
            pin. This pin picks up noise from around the circuit and can
            interfere with pretty much everything.Pull-Up or pull-down
            resistors, when used, filter out this noise, but are low enough
            resistor values that the input pin can still detect when you press
            the button (close the switch, etc).</p>
          <p>I looked into how to set up these so called "pull-up resistors",
            and lo and behold, the ATmega328P already has them built into it's
            microcontroller! Super nice.</p>
          <p>I went into my code, and instead of defining my pins like this:</p>
          <p><code>pinMode(inHour, INPUT);</code><br>
            <code>pinMode(inMinute, INPUT);</code>I defined them like this:</p>
          <p><code>pinMode(inHour, INPUT_PULLUP);</code><br>
            <code>pinMode(inMinute, INPUT_PULLUP);</code>Then, in my functions
            where I had previously written the pins to expect a HIGH input, I
            changed that to LOW.<br>
            I did this because pull-up resistors "pull" the voltage of the input
            pin up, so the pin is HIGH, and only triggers when it receives a LOW
            signal. The inverse is true when talking about pull-down resistors.
            Pull-down resistors enable the pin as LOW, and the pin waits for a
            HIGH signal.</p>
          <p>After reloading the code and making sure I had the correct circuit
            setup with the buttons, I tested them out.</p>
