        <div>
          <p>Materials:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>64 LEDs - 3mm</li>
            <li style="width: 746px;">Resistors (you can calculate the amount of
              resistance you need, I used 200ohm)</li>
            <li>a through-hole generic PCB board</li>
            <li style="width: 745px;">Wooden board (not huge, just big enough to
              stick the LEDs in to solder the layers)</li>
            <li>Hookup wire</li>
            <li>Male-to-male jumper wires</li>
            <li>Craft wire (I used 0.8mm)</li>
            <li>Jumper wires</li>
            <li style="width: 746px;">Elegoo Uno (I bought the Elegoo knockoff
              of an Arduino since I didn't have a ton of money, it works exactly
              the same!)</li>
            <li>A LOT of solder</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Tools:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Soldering station</li>
            <li>Drill (with 3mm OR 1/8in drill bit)</li>
            <li>Wire cutters and strippers</li>
            <li>Round nose pliers</li>
            <li>crocodile clips (very, <em>very</em> useful)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">Step 1: Measure out equidistant holes in your
            wooden board. It's really important that they're as equal as you can
            get it, or else your LEDs are going to stand all wonky, and it'll be
            hard to solder them all together.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="../images/cube-1.jpg" title="project cube"></p>
          <p>I measured the holes about 1/2in apart.</p>
          <p>Step 2: Drill the holes!</p>
          <img src="../images/cube-2.jpg" alt="" title="project cube" style="width: 748px;"><br>
          <p style="width: 746px;">It helps to have an LED right next to you to
            make sure it'll fit nicely in each hole.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">Step 3: Solder the LED strips.<br>
            Take all the LEDs and bend the cathode (the short, negative lead) in
            such a way that it doesn't touch the anode (the longer lead), and
            make sure when you fit them into the holes on your wooden board that
            the cathodes overlap each other so you can solder them together,
            like so:</p>
          <img src="../images/cube-3.jpg" alt="" title="project cube" style="width: 746px;"><br>
          <br>
          <p style="width: 748px;">Once you solder all the strips, lay them out
            in each set of holes, (with all the cathodes pointing the same way),
            and....</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">Step 4: Cut some craft wire and solder it
            across the LED strips to make it a square!<br>
            <img src="../images/cube-5.jpg" alt="" title="cube"></p>
          <p></p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">At this point I recommend using a 9V battery
            with a resistor on the positive (red) lead, and with the black lead
            touching the craft wire, go through and test all the LEDs to see if
            any burnt out or aren't working. Trust me, it'll save a LOT of time
            if you have to replace one now rather than later.</p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">Step 5: Solder the layers!<br>
            Line the layers up on top of each other (one at a time), and
            remember that you're *only soldering the leads pointing up*.<br>
            <img src="../images/cube-6.jpg" alt="" title="cube"></p>
          <p></p>
          <p style="width: 751px;">If you're having a bit of trouble keeping the
            cube upright or the layers stable, the crocodile clips come in handy
            to steady the design.</p>
          <img src="../images/cube-7.jpg" alt="" title="cube" style="width: 746px;"><br>
          <p style="width: 747px;">The above picture was actually a mistake, I
            accidentally flipped the layer around the wrong way and had to
            desolder it because all the cathodes weren't pointing the right way.
            (The cathodes being the shorter leads that you bent earlier) I
            wanted to show an example of the crocodile clips, though.</p>
          <p>Once that's completed, you can turn the cube right side up!</p>
          <img src="../images/cube-8.jpg" alt="" title="cube" style="width: 748px;"><br>
          <p style="width: 746px;">You can trim all the excess <em>craft</em>
            wire off. As for the cathodes sticking out on the sides, I cut them
            in a stepping-stone fashion like <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-make-a-pulsating-arduino-led-cube-that-looks-like-it-came-from-the-future/"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">this tutorial said</a>, which will
            make things easier once we hook the LEDs up to a PCB.</p>
          <p>Step 6: Get the right PCB<br>
            <img src="../images/cube-9.jpg" alt="" title="cube" style="width: 747px;"></p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">I bought this PCB kit for...about $11, I
            think. It was a really good deal, these PCBs seem to work very
            nicely. They weren't as big as they needed to be, though, so I hot
            glued two of them together.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">This was probably the trickiest part of the
            whole project: getting 16 LED leads into tiny holes all at the same
            time. Round nose pliers were my best friend when I did it. Once you
            get them all in, solder all the joints at the bottom so all your
            hard work will stay in place!<br>
            <br>
            <img src="../images/cube-10.jpg" alt="" title="cube"></p>
          <p>Step 7: Put the resistors in.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Round nose pliers were super handy for this
            step as well. I chopped the leads of the resistors to be tinier than
            usual, then with some pliers I stuck them in the holes and soldered
            them in.<br>
            <img src="../images/cube-11.jpg" alt="" title="cube" style="width: 747px;"><br>
            <img src="../images/cube-12.jpg" alt="" title="cube" style="width: 747px;"><br>
            With the leftover resistor leads I used them as mini hookup wire to
            connect the resistors to the LEDs on the bottom of the board.<br>
            <img src="../images/cube-13.jpg" alt="" title="cube"><br>
            Step 8: Cut up some more craft wire and solder it to the negative
            stepping-stone leads, and wire them down to the PCB. <br>
            <img src="../images/cube-14.jpg" alt="" title="cube"><br>
            <img src="../images/cube-15.jpg" alt="" title="cube"><br>
            Step 9: Get some hookup wire, strip the ends, and pull them all
            towards the oval pads to connect to the jumper wire GPIO thingies.<br>
            <img src="../images/cube-16.jpg" alt="" title="cube"><br>
            I would recommend starting with the smaller hookup wires, I found it
            hard to solder around the bigger ones already in place without
            almost melting the insulation stuff. <br>
            <img src="../images/cube-17.jpg" alt="" title="cube"><br>
            Step 10: Solder the jumper wires to the board!<br>
            <img src="../images/cube-18.jpg" alt="" title="cube"></p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">As you can see, I color coded the wires based
            on which resistor it was connected to. That way, I'll have an easier
            time connecting the jumper wires to the GPIO pins on the Uno.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">I still have to get some small wire or just
            use solder to connect the hookup wire to the actual resistors and
            GPIOs, so the signals will actually flow through the circuit. But
            otherwise, the big job is finished.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">And that's it! I followed this tutorial the
            whole time: <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-make-a-pulsating-arduino-led-cube-that-looks-like-it-came-from-the-future/">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-make-a-pulsating-arduino-led-cube-that-looks-like-it-came-from-the-future/</a></p>
          <p style="width: 748px;">Next time, I'll put up a post on the Uno,
            loading the code, and getting it all to run.</p>
