              Programming Paradigms<br>
            </span></h2>
          <p>(disclaimer: this is a beginner's explanation and understanding of
            these programming paradigms. if there are any errors or confusion,
            please let me know and I will edit or correct those to become more
            understandable. this is intended to be a basic overview.)</p>
          <p>In my quest of self taught programming, I figured I've reached the
            point of needing to really understand what an object is, as well as
            the difference between the big types of programming:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</li>
            <li>Functional Programming (FP)</li>
            <li>Structured Programming (SP)</li>
            <li>Imperative Programming (IP)</li>
            <li>Procedural Programming (PP)</li>
            <li>Declarative Programming (DP)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>How do these all relate? What are the pros and cons of using each
            one? I decided to go on a researching rampage.</p>
          <p>Let's clarify some terms. What is a paradigm?</p>
          <ul>
            <li><abbr title="partOfSpeech">n.</abbr> A set of assumptions,
              concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing
              reality for the community that shares them, especially in an
              intellectual discipline.</li>
            <li><abbr title="partOfSpeech">n.</abbr> A system of assumptions,
              concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing
              reality.</li>
            <li><abbr title="partOfSpeech">n.</abbr> A conceptual framework—an
              established thought process.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So in our case, a paradigm is a way of looking at programming:
            understand the underlying framework of the language's ideas that
            make it work the way it does and implementing programs through the
            filter of that structure.</p>
          <p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm">wikipedia</a>
            says, "a programming paradigm is a way to classify a programming
            language based on the features it possesses.", filtering the
            abilities through a set of ideas to classify it. Programming
            languages can share qualities/features that tie into multiple
            paradigms, so there isn't one strict classification for each
            language.</p>
          <p>"Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the
            execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or
            whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution
            model. Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code
            is organized, such as grouping a code into units along with the
            state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly
            with the style of syntax and grammar." ~ wiki</p>

          <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Structured
                Programming </span></strong></p>
          <p>Structured programming focuses specifically on&nbsp;<em>program
              organization.&nbsp;</em>The programs are typically executed in the
            exact format it is laid out in, from beginning to end, using
            statements. There are four terms usually associated with structured
            programming:</p>
          <p><strong>Sequence</strong>: The order in which to execute the
            program, often a linear format of statements.</p>
          <p><strong>Selection:</strong> Based on the state of the program
            (local and global changes), statements are executed (Statements such
            as if/then/else/else-if).</p>
          <p><strong>Iteration</strong>: Iteration in the sense of SP has to do
            with a statement repeating or being executed until the desired
            program state is reached. (for/do, while, etc).</p>
          <p><strong>Recursion</strong>: The program repeatedly calls itself
            until the desired state of the program is reached or something
            external terminates it.</p>
          <p>Structured programming can be implemented in any language. It is
            often used for small, clear programs like OS system interrupts or
            external interrupts.</p>
          <hr>
          <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procedural
                Programming</span></strong></p>
          <p>Procedural programming is defined by a concept called "procedure
            calling". This is similar to functions, but the term focuses on
            different features.</p>
          <p>Procedures can be functions, routines, subroutines, and more. It's
            an overarching term for "a thing that does a series of other little
            things, kept in a box that you can call and open, filter a thing
            through, then close and put away".</p>
          <p>Some programming languages classified as "procedural" are C,
            Fortran, Go, and BASIC. Hardware is designed to support these
            languages with the stack register(s) (a register that holds all the
            calls, pointers, and organizes the program) to make sure that things
            are called correctly, and return successfully before moving onto the
            next procedure.</p>
          <hr>
          <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Imperative
                Programming</span></strong></p>
          <p>Considering a language as imperative is classified as programming
            with statements to change the state of the program. It's focus is to
            describe <em>with the commands</em> how the program works. It is
            concerned with the process of getting to the output, not necessarily
            the output itself.</p>
          <p>The idea is similar to imperative statements in the English
            language: if you say something imperatively, it is a command,
            something that implies you want a thing done. Translating this to
            programmer terms, you're literally commanding the computer to do
            things.</p>
          <p>To quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">wikipedia</a>,
            "imperative programs consist of <em>commands</em> for the computer
            to perform".</p>
          <p>Imperative programming is linear, which means you tell the computer
            every. little. step. you. want. it. to. take, and that's how it will
            be executed. You focus directly on how you're instructing the
            computer to do things. Lower level code in C or Assembly is
            considered imperative programming.</p>
          <p>Contrary to usage, procedural programming and imperative
            programming do not reference the same thing. While <em>imperative
              programming</em> focuses on <em>how</em> you're telling the
            program what to do, the structure you're writing it in, <em>procedural
              programming</em> is focused on the idea of <em>calling</em> those
            procedural "boxes" and executing them.<br>
            Procedural programming is a sub-classification of imperative
            programming, because you'll likely use the imperative code to <em>write</em>
            the procedures you want to call. "[T]he use of procedures has a
            dramatic effect on how imperative programs appear and how they are
            constructed." ~ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming">wiki</a></p>
          <hr>
          <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Declarative
                Programming</span></strong></p>
          <p>Declarative programming is the opposite of imperative programming,
            it is defined as "anything <em>not</em> imperative". The languages
            considered as so typically associate with mathematical logic, rather
            than explicitly listing the steps you want the computer to perform.
            The languages defined as declarative often have the ability to
            support no side effects (modifying things like variables outside of
            the function's scope, which depends on program state).</p>
          <hr>
          <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Functional
                Programming</span></strong></p>
          <p>Functional programming is a sub-classification of declarative
            programming. It is a style of programming that "treats computation
            as the evaluation of mathematical functions (expressions) and avoids
            changing-state [side effects] and mutable data." ~ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">wiki</a></p>
          <p>Imagine we have <code>function</code>, and we passed it <code>(x)</code>.
            Calling <code>function</code> twice with the same input value for <code>(x)</code>
            will result in the same return value of <code>f(x)</code><em>each
              time</em>, as opposed to having the output possibly change
            depending on a program's state (due to a local or global variable).</p>
          <p>This makes it much much easier to predict the outcome or behavior
            of a program, because you have more clarity on the flow of the data,
            you know what to expect.</p>
          <p>Functional programming is used in programs where you have a fixed
            set of data, but need to add new operations every once in a while to
            process it differently. Languages like Haskell, Common Lisp, Scheme,
            Clojure, and Erlang all support functional programming.</p>
          <p>Functional programming has some powerful implementations, like pure
            functions and high order functions. I don't understand them well
            enough to explain them here, so go and do some research for
            yourself!</p>
          <hr>
          <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Object Oriented
                Programming</span></strong></p>
          <p>Lets clarify what an object is: Objects are a thing that have a <em>state</em>
            and a <em>behavior.</em> If you take a look at literal objects
            around you:</p>
          <p>Phone:<br>
            My phone's state's can be On or Off, bright or dim, silent or
            ringing.<br>
            My phones behavior can increase volume, decrease volume, web surf,
            search, play music, pause music, send call, hang-up call (etc).</p>
          <p>Lamp:<br>
            Lamp's state: On, Off<br>
            Lamp's behavior: turn on, turn off, (maybe even explode!)</p>
          <p>Pencil:<br>
            State: mechanical (or wood), lead (vs ink), erase, don't erase<br>
            Behavior: write, delete/erase, refill, click</p>
          <p>An object in programming stores its <em>states</em> in fields (the
            storage of the data) and displays its <em>behavior</em> with
            methods or functions (the activity that will be performed on the
            data it receives).</p>
          <p>Object Oriented programming focuses on data, where you have fixed
            methods/operations that you pass new data to. Programs with OOP are
            rooted in the creation and interaction of objects themselves as they
            sift through the ever-changing data passed to them.</p>
          <p>Languages that support OOP or are designed specifically for OOP:
            Java, C++, C#, Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Swift, Dart, Scala, Common
            Lisp, and SmallTalk.</p>
          <p>Objects are extremely useful if implemented correctly. You can
            imagine objects as the nuts and bolts that, when built, work
            together as a machine. If the machine breaks, you replace one part,
            not the whole machine.</p>
          <p>Object oriented programming has one more term that is worth
            mentioning, called data-encapsulation. Think of objects like the
            human body and it's makeup. There are all the internal organs
            inside, but we can't access them unless we do specific things. Say
            we wanted to access the stomach, to do so, we would eat food. We
            inputted the food, it goes through the stomach, is processed, and
            I'm sure you can imagine what the output is.</p>
          <p>Did we see on the inside everything that was happening to the food?
            Nope! We passed an argument, and got a value returned. Data
            encapsulation is the idea of hiding the <em>state of the data</em>
            until it is <em>returned</em> by the object.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>I hope this was educational to you, as it was to me! Now I fully
            understand more what people mean when they reference these terms,
            and hopefully I can start implementing these ideas into my own
            programs.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me and ask
            more. Corrections and clarifications are welcome!</p>
