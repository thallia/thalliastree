          <h2><span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;">Who Am I</span></h2>
          <p style="width: 858px;"><span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;"><u><b><strong>short
                    answer:</strong></b></u> Welcome! I'm thallia, autodidact in
              the subjects of electrical and computer engineering, programming,
              mathematics, sciences, and natural medicine.</span></p>
          <p style="width: 838px;"><span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;"><strong>fun
                fact (because everybody likes those):</strong> my pseudonym
              originates from element 81 of the periodic table, <em>thallium</em>.
              I chose that elemental name as it comes after my mentor's
              pseudonym, Mercury. (He also goes by the name <em>fouric</em>,
              which I'll most likely reference him by that name on this blog.)</span></p>
          <p style="width: 838px;"><span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;"><u><b><strong>medium
                    answer:</strong></b></u> Sometime soon I will be going to
              college for an Electrical Engineering degree. With that knowledge
              I hope to further my career by increasing the availability of
              technical resources for natural medicine and naturopathic research
              and development. I also hope to become a published fiction author,
              writing fantasy and sci-fi novels for young adults.</span></p>
          <p style="width: 830px;"><span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;"><u><b><strong>long
                    answer:</strong></b></u> I believe that cultivating a love
              of learning in students is crucial to their careers. My love of
              learning began with my science teacher. She showed me how science
              could be fun, and the discovery of how the world works in all its
              beauty was an enjoyable past-time. When I took her chemistry
              class, I fell in love with the subject and the mathematics that
              went along with it. As I continued to grow under her teaching, she
              encouraged me to look into a career in engineering.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;">I can't tell you how crazy
              I thought she was.</span></p>
          <p style="width: 823px;"><span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;">I had
              my whole life planned out before then; I was going to be a fantasy
              author and a stay-at-home mom. Boy, was I in for a surprise.</span></p>
          <p style="width: 806px;"><span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;">I
              looked into some college summaries about engineering programs and
              degrees, which sparked my interest in computer and electrical
              engineering. I knew fouric was getting a degree in electrical
              engineering, so I messaged him about any resources he might have
              that I could look into. He sent me a few, and I ate them up like
              nobody's business.</span></p>
          <p style="width: 804px;"><span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;">Eventually
              I was messaging him everyday with questions, so much so that he
              asked if he could mentor me. My answer? <em>Heck yes.</em></span></p>
          <p style="width: 802px;"><span style="font-family: Ubuntu Mono;">Ever
              since, I have been researching ways to learn, venturing into the
              artistic world of programming, computer engineering, and
              electrical engineering with the help of my trusty mentor. On this
              site I hope to share some of my adventures, research, and
              discoveries with you.</span></p>
