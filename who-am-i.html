            </strong></h2>
          <p><strong><br>
            </strong></p>
          <p style="width: 746px;"><strong>short answer:</strong> Welcome! I'm
            thallia, autodidact in the subjects of electrical and computer
            engineering, programming, mathematics, sciences, and natural
            medicine.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;"><strong>fun fact (because everybody likes
              those):</strong> my pseudonym originates from element 81 of the
            periodic table, <em>thallium</em>. I chose that elemental name as
            it comes after my mentor's pseudonym, Mercury. (He also goes by the
            name <em>fouric</em>, which I'll most likely reference him by that
            name on this blog.)</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;"><strong>medium answer:</strong> Sometime soon
            I will be going to college for an Electrical Engineering degree.
            With that knowledge I hope to further my career by increasing the
            availability of technical resources for natural medicine and
            naturopathic research and development. I also hope to become a
            published fiction author, writing fantasy and sci-fi novels for
            young adults.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;"><strong>long answer:</strong> I believe that
            cultivating a love of learning in students is crucial to their
            careers. My love of learning began with my science teacher. She
            showed me how science could be fun, and the discovery of how the
            world works in all its beauty was an enjoyable past-time. When I
            took her chemistry class, I fell in love with the subject and the
            mathematics that went along with it. As I continued to grow under
            her teaching, she encouraged me to look into a career in
            engineering.</p>
          <p>I can't tell you how crazy I thought she was.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">I had my whole life planned out before then;
            I was going to be a fantasy author and a stay-at-home mom. Boy, was
            I in for a surprise.</p>
          <p style="width: 747px;">I looked into some college summaries about
            engineering programs and degrees, which sparked my interest in
            computer and electrical engineering. I knew fouric was getting a
            degree in electrical engineering, so I messaged him about any
            resources he might have that I could look into. He sent me a few,
            and I ate them up like nobody's business.</p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Eventually I was messaging him everyday with
            questions, so much so that he asked if he could mentor me. My
            answer? <em>Heck yes.</em></p>
          <p style="width: 746px;">Ever since, I have been researching ways to
            learn, venturing into the artistic world of programming, computer
            engineering, and electrical engineering with the help of my trusty
            mentor. On this site I hope to share some of my adventures,
            research, and discoveries with you.</p>
          <p>Thank you for stopping by!</p>
