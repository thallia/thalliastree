          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b>short answer:</b></u>
          Welcome! I'm thallia, autodidact in the subjects of electrical and
          computer engineering, programming, mathematics, sciences, and natural
          medicine.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b>fun fact (because
              everybody likes those):</b></u> my pseudonym originates from
          element 81 of the periodic table, thallium. I chose that elemental
          name as it comes after my mentor's pseudonym, Mercury. (He also goes
          by the name fouric, which I'll most likely reference him by that name
          on this blog.)<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>medium answer:</u></b>
          Sometime soon I will be going to college for an Electrical Engineering
          degree. With that knowledge I hope to further my career by increasing
          the availability of technical resources for natural medicine and
          naturopathic research and development. I also hope to become a
          published fiction author, writing fantasy and sci-fi novels for young
          adults.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b>long answer:</b></u>
          I believe that cultivating a love of learning in students is crucial
          to their careers. My love of learning began with my science teacher.
          She showed me how science could be fun, and the discovery of how the
          world works in all its beauty was an enjoyable past-time. When I took
          her chemistry class, I fell in love with the subject and the
          mathematics that went along with it. As I continued to grow under her
          teaching, she encouraged me to look into a career in engineering.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't tell you how crazy
          I thought she was.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had my whole life planned
          out before then; I was going to be a fantasy author and a stay-at-home
          mom. Boy, was I in for a surprise.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked into some college
          summaries about engineering programs and degrees, which sparked my
          interest in computer and electrical engineering. I knew fouric was
          getting a degree in electrical engineering, so I messaged him about
          any resources he might have that I could look into. He sent me a few,
          and I ate them up like nobody's business.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually I was messaging
          him everyday with questions, so much so that he asked if he could
          mentor me. My answer? Heck yes.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since, I have been
          researching ways to learn, venturing into the artistic world of
          programming, computer engineering, and electrical engineering with the
          help of my trusty mentor. On this site I hope to share some of my
          adventures, research, and discoveries with you.<br>
          <br>
